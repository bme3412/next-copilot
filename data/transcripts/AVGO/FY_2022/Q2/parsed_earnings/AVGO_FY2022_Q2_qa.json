          "content": "To answer right to the bottom line, we see a lot of benefits in putting all these various franchises we have, hardware and software under one umbrella. Think of it this way, Toshiya, it's like what merchant silicon is driving that trend. The old model is you sell a black-box hardware and software system to a customer in the IT department -- to J.P. Morgan IT department. That's what you do in the past. If something goes wrong, you ask a support, you scream for help, and because you don't know what's going on inside the thing. We are creating a model of disaggregation between hardware and software. We may still not know much about systems, but we sure know the technology that enables systems, whether they are switches, routers, compute, storage. And this is Broadcom -- it is a model of disaggregating hardware and software. And combined, I think we are stronger than divided. So, I hope that answers your question."

          "content": "Well, a very interesting question on networking side. It has been a trend, obviously, that has been happening for the last for over five years, which is in -- for us in networking, switching, and routing, merchant silicon has been taking share over proprietary solutions, black boxes, so to speak. Merchant solutions enable disaggregation of hardware and software. And that always offers more resiliency, more flexibility for customers. It starts with hyperscale. We are now talking about service providers and enterprise. And what perhaps has -- may be triggering an acceleration, which I indicated maybe is probably related to the fact that we are all, enterprises, in particular, are now all in reinvesting, upgrading after hiatus, probably from 2019 cutting through to the pandemic time frame. They are now investing in new data centers. And they are now investing in basically modernizing their data centers and they're going for next generation. And that we figure is what's triggering it. We are seeing acceleration in our Tomahawk 3s and 4s, we're seeing some of the leading-edge products, and the Trident versions correspondingly. We're seeing acceleration in Jericho2c and the latest one at the edge Qumran. All these are the big drivers. And it's almost a fast -- larger adoption than we would perceive under normal growth patterns. To put it bluntly, we're gaining market share in merchant silicon over proprietary solution. And it's an acceleration of a trend that has been going on over five years. And that is what is very clear. And in terms of supply chain question, I always get this question, and of course, I'll answer that point-blank: Over the past 12 months or so, we are challenged on making sure we meet demand on a timely basis in just what they want. And if you look at it that way, we do not see a challenge necessary in supply. Rather we see it as a demand -- constant demand challenge in the sense that we have to pass through our backlog carefully. And as I indicated in the last three months, we just bumped up our backlog substantially. And it doesn't -- in spite of lead times being unchanged -- unextended and unchanged. So, there is demand out there that keeps coming in for our products. And now it's particularly so in a couple of areas. It's not necessarily across the board, it is in a couple of areas. And we happen to be very lucky to be in those areas that are still strong, largely related to infrastructure. We are seeing in that networking, that includes both hyperscale, telcos, service providers, as well as enterprise. And particularly in enterprise, we are seeing, embellish a lot I might add, by content increase in server storage, connectivity, where we are now selling in the new generation, as I indicated in the last earnings call, subsystems where our customers prefer buying subsystems from us rather than just a chip. And that step-up content dramatically and on top of that, we're still continuing strong demand in this tool space, we are seeing -- continue to see not just revenue accelerating, but bookings accelerating. And these are real demand. And we have, of course, the supply to meet those critical needs as we see."

          "topic": "VMware Business Growth and EBITDA",
          "content": "Sure, Ross, thanks for the question. Let me start and then I'll let Hock embellish. When we think about the top line, a number of things are going on. But fundamentally, and this is actually back on Slide 7 if everyone has the deck, it's all about workload growth. I mean, if you think about private cloud growing, you know, mid- to high single digits, public cloud growing high double digits. That's what's really going to drive the top line fundamentally, and that's actually what it got us comfortable with the key business case here. I think in addition to that, we are going to focus on going through a transition and a rapid transition from perpetual licensing to subscription. As you know, with the software business, we've been totally focused on pretty much 100% recurring revenue. And we see ARR growth being able to sustain at 5%, if not faster, when we think about the combined business. When we think about EBITDA, they're in multiple knobs. We covered that. You can look at Slide 13. In terms of R&D, we're going to reinvest back in the core business, the core franchises. If you think about the three different pillars of this business, and I went through it. But it's really the core infrastructure business, vSAN, vSphere, vRealize. These are the businesses that are core to driving the bulk of the revenues, and that's where the reinvestment is going to occur. We are going to focus on our common customers. We have a significant go-to-market engine here at Broadcom software, obviously, so does VMware in their own regard, actually much more significant than ours. And so, we have a direct sales force, and we're going to leverage the fact that we have common coverage in both of those areas and take advantage of getting synergies there. But beyond that, we also see a very valuable channel. I think there's some things we've learned relative to the CA and the Symantec acquisitions -- in terms of the value of the channel, and we want to continue to support that channel. And that's going to allow us to support a lot more revenues in a cost-effective way. So, we see some real opportunity to leverage that. And then, of course, as you all know, we run G&A at 1% of revenue. We've been integrating companies for a long time. We have tremendous scale. This is going to give us even more significant scale going forward. And we think there's a lot of opportunity there to drive synergies from the redundancies we see."

        {
          "topic": "VMware ASIC Business Growth",
          "content": "Yeah. No, certainly. I mean, if you think about it, from a go-to-market standpoint, that's where software companies spend the bulk of their dollars. The fact that we're going to go from $5-plus billion of software revenue to much closer to $20 billion is a big deal. And the fact that we can leverage the combined go-to-market engine at that scale gives us huge economies. I think what we're going to be able to do is marry effectively a direct sales force which covers the largest couple of thousand customers. These are large multinationals across all the key verticals, primarily focused in North America and Europe, but also in parts of Asia with a very significant channel partner arrangements. I think one thing we've learned is there's an opportunity to embrace the channel, the two-tier distribution model, distribution partners, and key value-added resellers. There's also a big GSI opportunity. We worked significantly with GSIs on our side, so does VMware. And so, when I look at that in its totality, what we can't do today, given our scale, we can definitely take advantage of with the newfound scale between the two companies. Beyond that, when you think about the R&D side of the equation, to dig deeper into it and follow up when we talked about with Ross. When you think about what supports the development of software, there's a lot of what we refer to sometimes in the similar side as central engineering. So, software business operations, this is the continuous delivery, continuous testing capability, the ability to continuously develop applications on a consistent basis, that's expensive. It requires having your own private data centers or working with cloud providers and having the scale to be able to drive that kind of R&D investment over a much larger portfolio is also going to drive significant benefits. So, hopefully, that helps answer your question."

          "topic": "Software Business Synergies and Growth",
          "content": "Yeah. No, you're picking up on it, Stacy. I think a lot of it is because of the portfolio and the fact that we had partners in the online. Yeah, Stacy, a lot of it is based on the portfolio and the breadth of capability that VMware has relative to where we sit today. You're right. When we bought CA, mainframe made up at least half of the revenues. Today's mainframe is still about 50% of the overall software business at Broadcom. That's very much levered toward about 500 accounts in what we call our strategic account area, which is a direct sales motion. And that's also where we saw a lot of opportunity to drive customer synergy with Symantec, particularly around some of the Blue Coat and DLP activities that we were driving. So, that was the business model that made sense. That, of course, meant we could drive operating margins, frankly, slightly north of 70% because we didn't have to invest as much in our go-to-market motion. I think with VMware, when we look at it and we look at the fact that vSphere, going back to the core, serves over 300,000 customers, and we look at the growth that the company is driving with their more modern applications, whether it be for private cloud or public cloud, we see a much bigger opportunity. And so, to support that opportunity, we need to invest in sales and marketing. So, when you think about the 60s EBITDA margins that I was discussing, I think I said mid-60s. That's on a much bigger scale, but at a lower EBITDA margin profile that we're running today. All of that variance is going back into the sales and marketing investment. And we think from learning about, you know, how we [Inaudible] and Symantec, and frankly, you know, some of the revenues that we gave up, we think we can actually go back and reinvest in the channel and continue to drive revenue growth profitably. We don't want to walk away from the channel. We actually want to embrace it."

You gave a bit of a long-term model, mid-single-digit revenue growth, and then mid-single or mid-60s EBITDA. Can you talk a little bit about the revenue growth side of that equation? It seems like the VMware asset according to -- the street is growing a little bit faster than that. What are you doing and assuming as far as the growth rate of that piece? And then on the EBITDA side of things, out of the levers you showed on, I think it's Slide 13. Can you just give us an idea of how those all fall in to get you to that mid-60s level overall?"

        "questions": "Hi. Thank you very much. Excuse me, Tom, just getting back to following up on what Ross was asking. This asset is very different than the other two, in terms of growth rate, growth trajectory. It doesn't seem like you would need to divest pieces of the business like you had to -- the other two. Can you just talk us through the synergies that you see in combining these businesses -- and if these businesses in parts have had partnerships in the past? And how would you change that on a go-forward basis? Getting back to Hock's comment on longer term, this could be a faster-growing software business than what you're laying out today. Thank you."

        "questions": "OK. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, I found your comments on leveraging the new channel differently to be interesting because I guess I'm going to oversimplify, but your prior strategy was sort of to focus on the largest customers and kind of let the long tail sort of wither. Am I right in sort of thinking that you are sort of changing that now, you're going to be going after that long tail a little harder because now you actually have the channel to do it? And will that be like feeding into the other -- it sounds like it'd be feeding into the other businesses as well. I guess maybe could you talk a little bit more about how that business model is changing, especially in that like tail of smaller customers? What does that actually mean for the degree of cost synergies and everything that can come out of this relative to what you've seen before? And it doesn't sound like you're seeing that driving upside to the growth rate. You're still talking about mid-single digits, although, again, maybe there's some conservatism in that number. But anything you could give us on maybe some of that change in the business model, especially around the long tail of customers would be helpful."

Do you see any product overlap that any regulator could push back against? And why is there a \"Go Shop\" provision? And then on the accretion side, will this be accretive in Year 1. And I think, Tom, you said mid-60s EBITDA margin. Is that for VMware only? Or is that for your entire software business? Because the rest of the software business is running closer to 70%, I believe. So, just any thoughts on the process and the accretion would be very helpful. Thank you."

Hock, for a change, I've got a question on some of your business commentary related to organic Broadcom. You mentioned that in the networking business, you're seeing proprietary solutions from your customers losing out to merchant solutions and silicon that you guys sell. I was curious, is there anything happened recently, which is driving the shift over to your solutions? Or was this just something in the making a long time and it's just now happening? And also, if you can talk about supply concerns, you don't seem to be seeing any supply issues, whereas the other guys are. I'd be curious about color on that."
