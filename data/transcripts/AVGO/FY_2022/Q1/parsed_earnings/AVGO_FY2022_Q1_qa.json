And I mean -- and true, the rail demand that we're seeing underlying -- if you talk about underlying trend that is sustainable, at least in this upcycle, you're right, it's -- while we're showing 30% in networking, in server storage, a part of it is driven by ASP increases simply because we are passing on our material cost increases, wafer, substrates, assembly to our customers, inevitably. But it's much less than you probably think it is. What is really sustainable is what Harlan said in the previous question. We think the trend demand increase is more like closer to 20% year on year than what perhaps in dollar terms you're represented. And how long would it last? Who knows? It's hard for me to figure out because I've been wrong so many times. And this is now going on into the almost -- '22 is done and is strong. We're now booking, given our lead times, I indicated, in '23. And '23, I think, will be -- at least the first half of '23, we'll still be pretty close to the same. And it's the latter part of '23 and '24 that we have to figure out whether there's enough supply that will start coming in to basically address what is today and what we're seeing an extremely strong demand environment, whether it's from enterprise, telcos and service providers and hyperscale. All three are strong."

          "content": "Well, I could tread on my usual statement because it happens to be true, which is year upon year, under normal situations, yes, we see this 100-basis-points expansion of gross margin on our semiconductor front. You get that. Now Kirsten just indicated, we did better than that in semiconductor. And I guess -- and the reason why we did better than that this season, so to speak, if you come back to my remarks, there's a lot of deployment -- launch and deployment of new-generation products that I mentioned. We're talking about in networking, Tomahawk 4, and much more. Trident 4, which is more toward some data centers that use in enterprises. Tomahawk 4, used in hyper cloud, that new generation. Then we talk about Jericho being deployed -- the latest Jericho being deployed in the backside networks of machine learning, AI, GPU interconnectivity. That's a whole new application. Then we talk -- in service storage, I've talked about a whole slew of new-generation solutions, which we put in place toward -- basically, for new generation, leading-edge servers out there from the guys who do those servers. And with those new generations, we get that better margin. So in all, I guess additional input I put in is a lot more new-generation products coming out now, happen to be in '22. We're seeing happen. And of course, we are, in this environment, thankfully, able to pass on our cost increases to supply -- to customers. And that all adds up to a fairly decent gross margin set of results. But do not let that be an indicator, please. That it is something that will be a 200, 300 basis points expansion year on year. We still believe normal situation, it'd still be just on average, 100-basis-point expansion."

Enterprise demand spending is the strongest driver that we're seeing today. And it should be no surprise. It's something we have said since last quarter and the quarter before. Enterprise has recovered. More than recovered. It's going -- it's on fire, is the best way to describe it. Enterprise spending on IT is, as we perceive it, on fire. And we are seeing a big part of that. And that's not to say that hyper cloud and telcos are not adding to it, but not as strong as enterprise recovery."

And that's probably -- I'm definitely wearing rose-tinted glasses in this environment because demand is good and it's holding up still very well. Beyond that, I really don't know the answer to what you're saying. I do see content increasing over the next several years because we have various products, multiple products, not just one particular product. And we have multiple -- we have various products into every one of those very high-end smartphones, and that gives us opportunity to expand footprint and to strengthen and increase our content. We never really plan for unit increases actually in all our plan. We just plan on some content increase year after year, but never on any unit increase. So, I guess I don't -- I stop thinking or worrying about whether the number of phones is going to decline in 5G in the next one or two years as much as would the content decline from -- and we have not really seen it on -- in any fashion that would make us worry."

        "questions": "Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and execution. Hock, given your backlog and extended lead times, you've got pretty good visibility into this year. Your end markets are strong, right? Cloud and hyperscale. Capex spending is looking to grow about 30%. You're driving the 200 and 400 gig networking upgrade cycle. Enterprise spending is still expanding. As you mentioned, Broadcom continues strong, whether it's DOCSIS, Wi-Fi, fiber upgrades. And then on your compute acceleration, ASIC pipeline, you've got Google, Facebook, Microsoft, all of these guys ramping. So it seems like the demand, your product leadership, seasonality can sustain a sort of low to mid-20% plus-type year-over-year revenue growth profile through this year. So I guess the question for you is do you have line of sight and confidence on sustaining this type of growth through the year? And then more importantly, do you have the supply commitments to support this type of growth?"

And then the more important question is that there is a perception that semiconductor companies are benefiting abnormally because of a pricing lever because of the tight supply conditions. And as the foundry capacity eases, that your costs will go down and the pricing advantage will disappear. And I was hoping you could give us some more color, how much of a role is pricing playing in the expected sales growth this year on a like-to-like basis versus what you saw last year?"

        "questions": "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hock, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So you did like 75.5% in the quarter, 71% for the semis. And if I sort of like squint at your guidance, it implies gross margins into Q2 at least at that level, if not even probably higher. And this is amid cost increases and everything else. So I mean how do we think about like the limited -- I know you always talked about margins kind of going up 100 basis points a year, and they seem to be doing even better than that. Do we just keep modeling them going up from here? Or do you think they take a pause? Are there are any other drivers like into the back of this year, mix, or anything else, that would sit on that? Just how do we think about it just given the levels that they're sitting at right now?"

It's good to see that rising as much as it did sequentially, especially considering the lead times stayed flat. While the magnitude is impressive, I really wanted to ask about the profile of that and how it may or may not be changing. So as that additional backlog comes in, given all the moving parts between enterprise and cloud and broadband and wireless, etc., any sort of changes in the profile of that backlog that you find to be interesting, either in a positive or negative sense, that will give us a clue about the future growth drivers for your company?"

        "questions": "Yes, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, usually at this point in the cycle, with lead times extended as much as they are and you guys getting pricing power, the big concern on Wall Street is to what extent is the demand you're seeing real demand versus perhaps your customers building inventory. And I know you're less consumer focused than most. And so maybe inventory builds are less relevant in some of these infrastructure markets. But I'm wondering if you could give us your perspective on -- or at least what you guys try to do to scrub the backlog to make sure it's good demand. And if you think it's good demand, I'm kind of curious, you've always had a very realistic view of what the long-term growth rate for your semi should be -- semi business should be. Is that beginning to change? And like many of your peers who have put up a higher kind of new CAGR, are you willing to go there right now?"

It's been very strong, but you've been recently talking about some trade-offs that one of your customers making is -- making it a little even more concentrated on a single customer. And I know that you consider selling this business some time back. But does -- even further -- your further revenue concentration, does it make you rethink maybe how committed you want to be to that segment? And maybe whether you could redeploy this capital into another market, especially as things might be changing on the modem side. Thank you."

        "questions": "Thank you. Well, since we are talking about wireless, I wanted to follow up with that. Thanks for that answer, Hock, but I want to step back and maybe look at the longer term on this. You -- when you bought Brocade, it kind of shifted the narrative from we don't really need revenue growth. We're mostly looking for cash flow and high margins, which worked out very well. In wireless, you get a little bit different animal with Samsung on the way out because they shifted their phone strategy to more cost-centric and less performance-wise. It made sense for Broadcom not to participate there. And your large customer is doing fine. It looks like they will be for years. But as we've already seen on the high end, 5G, the growth in revenue -- growth in content is slowing. And by all measures, it will likely stagnate in the next three to four years. In that kind of environment, and especially if you're not doing any custom designs anymore, given -- it's just a given that revenue may not grow. If margins are affected, what do you do with it? I mean you've not ever embraced the business where both revenue is flat to down and margins are in decline. I think the question a lot of folks have is, what could you possibly do? It's so large and there are so few suitors for it. It's kind of puzzling in three years or four years what the strategy would be with wireless. Maybe you could help shed a light on that."

What do you see the long-term growth there, meaning if you look at the next 12 to 24 months on the networking side? I had a follow-up. Thanks. And one last question. On the software side, obviously, since December 8 when you announced the big buyback. Obviously, software valuations have become much more attractive in the last -- might be down 30%, 40% there. But do you have a target in mind as to what you think that software business should be, like 24%, 25% of revenues now? Are you looking to build it up to half of your business? Or is there a long-term target that you're putting out there? Thanks."
