          "topic": "Infrastructure Demand and Hyperscale vs Enterprise",
          "content": "All right. Great question. What we see now, last quarter and this current quarter as we progress is hyperscale spending continues strong; enterprise consumption continues strong; and broadband deployment across North America, Europe, and even parts of Asia continues their multiyear trend of growth simply because out of COVID-19, there was a lot of invest -- there was a lot of plans to invest, and these are multiyear. So, exactly as I said, all these areas currently continue to be very much on track as we've seen it.\n\nNow, keep in mind, as I said in previous earnings call and I'd just reemphasize here today, again, it's -- I just want to assure you, we don't believe we are shipping beyond true demand. We continue to scrub -- to basically judge orders, the backlog we have, and we also take pains to only ship to customers who can consume it pretty much within the same quarter before we do it. And so, as far as we can tell, based on what we see as a willingness of our customers to accept and consume the products we ship, that's what we see right now. Asking me for the rest of '23, no, I tend to be more careful in being able to answer that.\n\nI don't know the answer to that is my opinion. I do not know whether the strength in acquisition and consumption of our products will continue to sustain for the rest of '23. What we do see is over the next several months, we see those orders still in place. We see customers willing to take the products.\n\nWe have -- talking to multiple, multiple CIOs among largest enterprise customers we have out there. We have not seen them talk about a reduction in their IT spending. We've seen many saying it will grow and others saying it will at least remain flat. So, I guess, I'm cautiously positive about trends looking forward."

          "topic": "Backlog Management and Demand Scrubbing",
          "content": "It comes down very simply to we continue to scrub our backlog in a manner this quarter, last quarter, no differently than we did it six months or a year ago. We haven't changed our focus on ensuring that we do not ship products to the wrong people who just put it on the shelves. That is still very much, very, very intact in our view. Our backlog continues to be way up there, and you're right, makes us change.\n\nAs you can see, one quarter, it would be broadband growing 20% year on year and networking growing 30% year on year, and the following quarter is broadband growing 30% year on year and networking growing 20%. And it impacts not just from hyperscale, bearing their purchases in, for lack of a better word, seasonal manner; it's also the particular end markets it goes to. So, there's a mix of backlog, and products we ship in any particular quarter will vary, and they all change. But it doesn't change the fact that we have still a very, very strong backlog.\n\nAnd what we're shipping, which is most important in the current quarter, we believe, is what we are reflecting as end demand for our products."

          "topic": "Semiconductor Backlog and Forecasting",
          "content": "Our backlog and our terms are very clear. We do not allow cancellation on our backlog. We have not seen that and -- to answer your second question. And on the first part, keep in mind, our revenue continued to grow each quarter sequentially as our backlog continues to build up.\n\nAnd compared to the preceding quarter, our backlog at the end of Q3 increased to $31 billion. So, we are still shipping below our booking rate."

          "topic": "Capital Allocation and Buyback Strategy",
          "content": "And don't forget, we're going to start buyback once the rules allow us to do that. And so, that's another return of cash to shareholders, and we fully intend to get that going as soon as we could.\n\nAs soon as we can, and we still have $13 billion under that program."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Compute Offload ASIC Business Growth",
          "content": "Yeah, you're right in that regard that we have multiple programs from the hyperscalers on custom or semi-custom silicon, or largely collectively we call as offload compute. And they all have -- do their own. So, that's -- in one way that's very positive and very opportunistic for our technologies to be deployed. On an ongoing basis, the tricky thing in all this is more will come on, the rate of ramp is harder for us to predict.\n\nThese are very lumpy programs, fairly large and lumpy, which is why we can get to $2 billion and a raise -- an increase of like, as you correctly say, a third from a year ago. But it's lumpy. And the trend is very hard for me to chart out unless you ask for it over the next five years. And even then, if you look it five years, it becomes a question of would these hyperscalers revert to merchant silicon versus continuing to use custom ASICs, and that poses another issue for me to figure it out.\n\nBut if you ask for me over the next year or two, where it will go, I'd be honest and say I'm not positioned to give you really a good forecast."

        {
          "topic": "Wireless Business Order Book and Forecasting",
          "content": "We have been all on paper, orders. These are real orders, noncancelable. So, we're giving you numbers that we intend to ship that we think the customer needs as far as we can scrub. And we have it.\n\nThese are committed orders. These are not forecasts at all, especially when you talk about Q1, which ends, by the way, end of January. We have orders beyond end of January as it is. So, these are very committed orders.\n\nAnd in that -- by that same token, pretty committed revenue forecast. Just to make it clear. And by the way, we have pretty good visibility from that particular customer, too. Now beyond that, to the second part of your question, yeah, we're very pleased with content increase that we have experienced, not every year necessarily, as you know.\n\nBut over a period of years, we always see this content increase. And we're still very, very well-positioned in our product -- in those few product lines that are, I call it, almost franchise in our North American customers. And this is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, this is RF front end, and this is touchscreen controllers, high performance, mixed single. And that's -- we can only -- and that's all we focus on because these are areas where we are the best, we believe we have the best technology and delivering value to our customers.\n\nThere's no reason to find something else where you're not the best and hope to gain share from someone else. I could apply the same to my competitors in their thinking.\n\nBut the answer is no."

I guess I was hoping you could speak more to why infrastructure to date has been so immune from the weakness we've seen elsewhere in semis. Specifically, can you speak to trends you're seeing perhaps in hyperscale versus enterprise? Any differences there? And also, can you speak to how you see these trends throughout all of fiscal '23? Thanks so much."

      "questions": "Hi, everybody. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I want to follow on C.J.'s and maybe ask similar question but in a slightly different way. Last quarter, you talked about actively scrubbing your backlog.\n\nAnd clearly, that's helped to avoid some of the inventory pitfalls that some of your peers have seen. But have you noticed since last quarter's call a change in either the rate of your backlog growth? I think it was up about 7% sequentially last quarter, the composition of your backlog, or how actively and aggressively you need to scrub it? Any sort of changes in those forward-looking metrics that would alter your view on kind of the sustainability of demand, the duration of it, etc.?"

Last quarter, I think you said your semiconductor backlog was $31 billion and your lead times were still 50 weeks, give or take.\n\nWhat are those numbers now? Like, where is backlog and where are lead times?"

      "questions": "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, your server storage connectivity business has been extremely strong, right, up 50% plus in fiscal '22. And more importantly, that business continues to sustain based on the January quarter outlook.\n\nWe typically tend to think about HDD controllers and preamps, but your business is much more diverse than this. So, can you just, first of all, walk us through like what percentage is MegaRAID, PCIe or what I call overall storage connectivity versus your storage controller business, which is primarily HDD controller and preamps? And maybe what's driving the near-term growth in the storage franchise when many of your storage competitors and customers are seeing major weakness in this segment?"

      "questions": "Hi. Hock, I was wondering if you could update us on the semi's backlog number. I think it was $25 billion last call, which was a little bit more than a year. Can you update us on that backlog number? And then also within that, have you seen any movement in the backlog? I mean, I know probably, it's up. But have you seen any customers cancel or push out? I mean, obviously, that was more than offset by incoming bookings, it sounds like. But sort of what's the fluidity within that backlog? Thanks."

Hock, I just wanted to clarify if any of your products are directly or indirectly exposed to any China restrictions that have been in the press over the last handful of days. And then, Hock, I wanted to ask the growth question in a different way, which is, in the past, you described a sustainable kind of mid-single-digit growth rate for Broadcom. Is that still a good framework to use as we are looking out at the next year or so? Or if you could give us maybe by end market, hyperscaler versus enterprise versus telco or consumer, which markets just conceptually you would expect to kind of grow better or slower than that kind of broad growth rate for the company?"

      "questions": "Thank you for taking my question. Hock, sometimes, we forget that historically, we've been at an ASP eroding sort of industry at least on a like part-for-part basis. So, I know the mix changes over time, but I think that's changed significantly in the last year and a half or so. I'm wondering whether you're seeing that dynamic continue or revert and if you can comment as to how that influencing margins. You're getting such tremendous contribution margins in the semi business. I would have to think pricing is playing some part in that. Thank you."

      "questions": "Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to ask about the wireless segment. You know, solid results just last quarter. It sounds like you're guiding 20% sequential growth into this current quarter. But if I look back over the past couple of years, it's actually been solidly above the 20% sequential growth rate. So, I guess how are you thinking about the demand profile there? And I guess with that, your content expansion opportunity as we look at the next-generation product cycle going forward. Thank you."

So, I apologize in advance for squeezing in one last one.\n\nAnd I was wondering if you look at the year as you see it books today if you could tell us in this like booking dynamics, where do you see for the full year 2023 the most growth and the least growth? I know you can't give us like numbers, and you don't want to guide. I completely accepted that. But if you could give us like a kind of idea of where things keep growing very fast, where things are slowing down in your order dynamics over the full year."

Hock, I wanted to ask a quick one and then a main question. There's been a lot of concerning sort of news coming out of China reported by company. So, I was curious, first of all, how much exposure do you have to China? And then for my main question, it's a question of sustainability. Somebody asked about revenues, but I wanted to ask about gross margins. You've got 90% odd margins in software that I think is the norm, but then you've got 72% gross margins in semis, which are sort of honestly abnormal compared to other companies. So, when you think of sustainability of that semi business up in the 70s, what do you think are some of the drivers that keep it up there for you guys longer term?"
