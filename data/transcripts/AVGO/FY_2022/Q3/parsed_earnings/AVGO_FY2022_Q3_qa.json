          "content": "Well, no. The short answer is no. And by that, this is what I mean. And this is something I've been talking about -- we've been talking about in the earnings call and in sell-side analyst calls about true demand. What we are mentioning, what we are reporting revenues is in our minds, and we've been looking at it that way the past eight quarters, particularly, as we told you. We scrub through our backlog thoughtfully, carefully before we deliver products to customers, end users, is that that's true end demand. And what we reported to you today, and you see the numbers that we're presenting and the strength of the numbers, if I could say so myself, it's true end demand what we're seeing with respect to the various end markets and the infrastructure products we sell to -- into those end markets. That's as far as we can scrub through true end demand. Now, we also have a ton of backlog, and our lead time continues unchanged at 50 weeks. Now, whether bookings that are placed today are running at somewhat different thoughts, different rates, it's more a function of perception, psychology of customers trying to think one year out. But as far as what we reported in Q3 and expect to see in Q4, we believe to be true end -- we believe, and we're pretty clear about that, to be true end demand and consumption by our customers."

          "content": "Well, I mean, we put in a lot of checks and balances hugely before we put products out on aircraft or trucks to our customers. And we have been doing this now for two years. So, we're pretty good at doing it. And the question earlier answered -- asked by Ross was, have you seen any particular change in all that? In terms of consumption of our products, and I can only obviously talk about our products, and I can talk beyond our products, no, we don't see that."

          "content": "No, we have not been notified. None of our products are affected by any action that have occurred over the last week or a few days regarding restriction on shipments of China. We have not been affected, period. And we do not expect to be, OK?"

          "topic": "Sustainable Growth Rate in Semiconductors",
          "content": "That second question is a very interesting question, but let me take care of the first. No, we have not been notified. None of our products are affected by any action that have occurred over the last week or a few days regarding restriction on shipments of China. We have not been affected, period. And we do not expect to be, OK? Now, in terms of what you're saying, now that calls for some degree of speculation, but it's more than that. I've always said the long-term sustainable demand in the semiconductor space is a mid-single-digit compounded growth rate, 5%, thereabout maybe 6%, 5%, 6%. And I still believe that no matter what all the -- I mean, the hubris, that marketing hubris that has occurred over the past 12 months, it always has been, and I think we will revert to that norm, eventually. Now, obviously, it's very interesting what we're seeing because it depends on when you start that compounded growth because 5% is what I said to be a long-term growth rate. In the short term in this industry, and we've all experienced these cycles, you could have higher than 5% at the upcycle and clearly much lower in the down cycles to average that 5%. But your point is at some point, we'll have to get back to the norm. And I believe we will, not in this year, '22. The rate '22 is growing. Now, we -- assuming our forecast Q4 comes to play. We're talking about semiconductor growth rate for us of around 25% year on year. And that's way above the 5% norm. So, at some point, yes, things will turn around and revert back to that norm. Now, it may take a couple of years before I get there."

          "topic": "ASIC Business Revenue and Sustainability",
          "content": "Actually, it isn't. I said that before in the previous earnings -- a couple of earnings calls. It's worthwhile for me to repeat. We have been able to raise prices, obviously, over the last past 12 months, but only because our material cost has gone up. And so, we're talking -- if we're talking percentages, not absolute dollars, if our cost -- material cost -- cost of goods sold, so expect increase 10% in order to keep our margin in percentage terms from being diluted with the raise the price no less than 10%. And just doing that, it's just staying -- it's just keeping the gross margin in percentage term staying neutral. So, I would say price increases has very little impact on our margin improvement. What is -- what has enabled our margins to accelerate or improve, as I said in the last earnings call, is in this environment of -- in some degree in the last couple of years -- last 12 months, in particular, of basically a pent-up level of spending, particularly in enterprise, somewhat in cloud as well and broadband as well, is the adoption of new next-generation products and technology. And that always enhances, as I've said that before, our gross margin. And it's just -- it's the basic fundamental of this semiconductor cycle. New generation of products improves, expands our gross margin. And the accelerated adoption is what expands this gross margin. And that's pretty much what has been the case here, but not price increase per se."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Semiconductor Gross Margin Expansion",
          "content": "Our semiconductor gross margin, by the way, we talk about sustainability, I would say it keeps expanding. It doesn't stay still, as you probably know. If you look back to five years ago, we were more like 60% -- in the mid-60s or low 60s gross margin. Today, it's now over 70%. And it's simply the case that -- and that's the beauty of the semiconductor technology business. You always have new generation of products, whether it's wireless, running -- creating a generation every 12 to 24 months, whether it's switching, that's every two, three years, our storage, every for five years. And every time you put in a new generation, you expand your margin because you're delivering more value, you're delivering much more value usually, and you are able to extract from the higher value a higher price and profitability. And that's the beauty of this industry. So, as we keep coming out with new generations, the margins of our portfolio keeps expanding. So, we're now at the 70s. And you ask where will we be five years from now in this phenomena of constantly updating to next-generation products, I will see this gross margin expansion continuing. And empirically -- don't ask me for any mathematical formula behind -- physics behind it. But empirically, given our portfolio of about 16 semiconductor franchises, we have averaged close to 50 to 100 basis points expansion year after year. And that's pretty good, and we see that trend continuing. And as I responded to an earlier question, over the last two years, we've -- the rebound you might almost think -- feel by perhaps changes in IT spending based on, I guess, lockdowns, based on behavioral changes with COVID-19, we've seen accelerated adoption of next-generation products in many of our franchises. So, we have seen some level of accelerated expansion of our semiconductor gross margin. But things will revert back, my belief, to a more normalized 50 to 100 basis point expansion once all this excitement starts cooling off a bit, but we still see the sustainable expansion of our semiconductor gross margin."

          "topic": "Wireless Business Growth and Content Expansion",
          "content": "OK. You know, it's -- on the wireless business, if I could try to clarify, when we take any particular three-month period like Q3 and going to be Q4 now and take a snapshot of it and compare it to the same period of time a year ago, it never quite replicate itself in all matters. In other words, it's not -- there's no normalization. So, it could be 20%. It could be 25%. It could even be 30% changes. And I consider that all kind of in the same ballpark, simply because all it takes is a slippage of a couple of weeks in shipments in products being taken to make that particular difference. So, I would not put too much thinking behind that is 20% whereas it might have been closer to 30% two years ago or a year ago in the same period, if you don't mind, simply because nothing comes up so as to be solid plan year over year. It changes. But in terms of overall volume, we do not see that much units dramatically different from a year ago. It's really the content increase that might give us the lift year on year. And even on a lift year-on-year quarter when you compare to any three-month period, take it with a grain of salt that some volume might have shifted forward not be within these months. But it's kind of in the ballpark."

          "topic": "VMware Revenue Growth and EBITDA Margins",
          "content": "Sure, Ross, thanks for the question. Let me start and then I'll let Hock embellish. When we think about the top line, a number of things are going on. But fundamentally, and this is actually back on Slide 7 if everyone has the deck, it's all about workload growth. I mean, if you think about private cloud growing, you know, mid- to high single digits, public cloud growing high double digits. That's what's really going to drive the top line fundamentally, and that's actually what it got us comfortable with the key business case here. I think in addition to that, we are going to focus on going through a transition and a rapid transition from perpetual licensing to subscription. As you know, with the software business, we've been totally focused on pretty much 100% recurring revenue. And we see ARR growth being able to sustain at 5%, if not faster, when we think about the combined business. When we think about EBITDA, they're in multiple knobs. We covered that. You can look at Slide 13. In terms of R&D, we're going to reinvest back in the core business, the core franchises. If you think about the three different pillars of this business, and I went through it. But it's really the core infrastructure business, vSAN, vSphere, vRealize. These are the businesses that are core to driving the bulk of the revenues, and that's where the reinvestment is going to occur. We are going to focus on our common customers. We have a significant go-to-market engine here at Broadcom software, obviously, so does VMware in their own regard, actually much more significant than ours. And so, we have a direct sales force, and we're going to leverage the fact that we have common coverage in both of those areas and take advantage of getting synergies there. But beyond that, we also see a very valuable channel. I think there's some things we've learned relative to the CA and the Symantec acquisitions -- in terms of the value of the channel, and we want to continue to support that channel. And that's going to allow us to support a lot more revenues in a cost-effective way. So, we see some real opportunity to leverage that. And then, of course, as you all know, we run G&A at 1% of revenue. We've been integrating companies for a long time. We have tremendous scale. This is going to give us even more significant scale going forward. And we think there's a lot of opportunity there to drive synergies from the redundancies we see."
        },
        {
          "topic": "VMware ASIC Business Growth and Synergies",
          "content": "Yeah. No, certainly. I mean, if you think about it, from a go-to-market standpoint, that's where software companies spend the bulk of their dollars. The fact that we're going to go from $5-plus billion of software revenue to much closer to $20 billion is a big deal. And the fact that we can leverage the combined go-to-market engine at that scale gives us huge economies. I think what we're going to be able to do is marry effectively a direct sales force which covers the largest couple of thousand customers. These are large multinationals across all the key verticals, primarily focused in North America and Europe, but also in parts of Asia with a very significant channel partner arrangements. I think one thing we've learned is there's an opportunity to embrace the channel, the two-tier distribution model, distribution partners, and key value-added resellers. There's also a big GSI opportunity. We worked significantly with GSIs on our side, so does VMware. And so, when I look at that in its totality, what we can't do today, given our scale, we can definitely take advantage of with the newfound scale between the two companies. Beyond that, when you think about the R&D side of the equation, to dig deeper into it and follow up when we talked about with Ross. When you think about what supports the development of software, there's a lot of what we refer to sometimes in the similar side as central engineering. So, software business operations, this is the continuous delivery, continuous testing capability, the ability to continuously develop applications on a consistent basis, that's expensive. It requires having your own private data centers or working with cloud providers and having the scale to be able to drive that kind of R&D investment over a much larger portfolio is also going to drive significant benefits. So, hopefully, that helps answer your question."

        {
          "topic": "Software Business Synergies and Growth Strategy",
          "content": "Yeah. No, you're picking up on it, Stacy. I think a lot of it is because of the portfolio and the fact that we had partners in the online. Yeah, Stacy, a lot of it is based on the portfolio and the breadth of capability that VMware has relative to where we sit today. You're right. When we bought CA, mainframe made up at least half of the revenues. Today's mainframe is still about 50% of the overall software business at Broadcom. That's very much levered toward about 500 accounts in what we call our strategic account area, which is a direct sales motion. And that's also where we saw a lot of opportunity to drive customer synergy with Symantec, particularly around some of the Blue Coat and DLP activities that we were driving. So, that was the business model that made sense. That, of course, meant we could drive operating margins, frankly, slightly north of 70% because we didn't have to invest as much in our go-to-market motion. I think with VMware, when we look at it and we look at the fact that vSphere, going back to the core, serves over 300,000 customers, and we look at the growth that the company is driving with their more modern applications, whether it be for private cloud or public cloud, we see a much bigger opportunity. And so, to support that opportunity, we need to invest in sales and marketing. So, when you think about the 60s EBITDA margins that I was discussing, I think I said mid-60s. That's on a much bigger scale, but at a lower EBITDA margin profile that we're running today. All of that variance is going back into the sales and marketing investment. And we think from learning about, you know, how we [Inaudible] and Symantec, and frankly, you know, some of the revenues that we gave up, we think we can actually go back and reinvest in the channel and continue to drive revenue growth profitably. We don't want to walk away from the channel. We actually want to embrace it."

Hock, you started off your preamble talking about the disconnect between some of the macro data points on the consumer side versus the infrastructure side. Obviously, you have a limited exposure on the consumer side of things. But in the networking broadband server, the enterprise and cloud businesses in general, are you seeing any changes? Because it's really hard for, I think, investors and even myself to reconcile the fact that everything is fine for you despite the macro data points seemingly are worsening for many of your peers."

      "questions": "OK. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, I found your comments on leveraging the new channel differently to be interesting because I guess I'm going to oversimplify, but your prior strategy was sort of to focus on the largest customers and kind of let the long tail sort of wither. Am I right in sort of thinking that you are sort of changing that now, you're going to be going after that long tail a little harder because now you actually have the channel to do it? And will that be like feeding into the other -- it sounds like it'd be feeding into the other businesses as well. I guess maybe could you talk a little bit more about how that business model is changing, especially in that like tail of smaller customers? What does that actually mean for the degree of cost synergies and everything that can come out of this relative to what you've seen before? And it doesn't sound like you're seeing that driving upside to the growth rate. You're still talking about mid-single digits, although, again, maybe there's some conservatism in that number. But anything you could give us on maybe some of that change in the business model, especially around the long tail of customers would be helpful."

And then, Hock, I wanted to ask the growth question in a different way, which is, in the past, you described a sustainable kind of mid-single-digit growth rate for Broadcom. Is that still a good framework to use as we are looking out at the next year or so? Or if you could give us maybe by end market, hyperscaler versus enterprise versus telco or consumer, which markets just conceptually you would expect to kind of grow better or slower than that kind of broad growth rate for the company?"

And then specifically, Hock, in your compute offload, right, you got some really nice programs like GPU, [Inaudible] video transcode. Is the team still on track to drive $2 billion in compute offload ASIC revenues this year? And then just given the strategic nature of these ASIC programs to your customers' future initiatives, like will this segment hold up better in a weaker macro environment, let's say, next year?"

I'm wondering whether you're seeing that dynamic continue or revert and if you can comment as to how that influencing margins.

So, I was curious, first of all, how much exposure do you have to China? And then for my main question, it's a question of sustainability. Somebody asked about revenues, but I wanted to ask about gross margins. You've got 90% odd margins in software that I think is the norm, but then you've got 72% gross margins in semis, which are sort of honestly abnormal compared to other companies. So, when you think of sustainability of that semi business up in the 70s, what do you think are some of the drivers that keep it up there for you guys longer term?"
