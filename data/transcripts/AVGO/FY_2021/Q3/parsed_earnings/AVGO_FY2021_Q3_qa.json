          "content": "OK. Let me take the question one at a time. On arrangements with long-term agreements, John, this is something we have been thoughtfully, carefully putting in place with our core strategic customers. We just don't go do it as if it's commoditized. We're very thoughtful about doing it, and we do it in very specific areas where we know for sure that the technology is fairly, fairly difficult, complex to manage and which requires a substantial amount of R&D spending. And we've been doing it for a while now with strategic customers in core businesses. So we just don't do it across the board. And what you pointed out is very, very correct. It's a mutual structure, it's an agreement with mutual benefit. We have the confidence to invest in R&D to make capex capacity investment. And in return, we offer the best leading-edge technology in specific areas in a timely manner to our critical customers. So yes, we have been doing it, and we will continue to thoughtfully do it in a very appropriate manner."

          "topic": "Enterprise Recovery and Spending Trends",
          "content": "It is across -- it is for enterprise spending. I won't say across the board necessarily and trying to define enterprise very appropriately. As you noticed in my comments, we've classified service providers, telcos as a separate animal, different from traditional enterprise. And as I pointed out, based on broadband, telcos have been investing big time. Service providers, telcos have been investing in a huge manner over the past 12 months. But traditional enterprise, the companies, whether it's the banks, the manufacturing sector, various retail customers, airlines, examples, no, these guys are in a recovery mode. And not surprising, we are seeing pandemic easing like, say, in North America. And as it eases, we see a step-up in spending. But we do not see spending spiking up. Now, obviously, if you look at some businesses like warehouses that require WiFi networks, campus networking environment, you do see that improving. But to say across the board, all enterprises are just spending money, we are still seeing -- and as I showed that in server storage connectivity, we still see year on year, things are not up to what it was a year ago. And that applies not just on data centers, namely compute. It also applies to data centers in enterprise, campus environment. We see less of that but across the board."

          "topic": "Networking Growth and Customer Demand Sustainability",
          "content": "We don't really try to guide more than one quarter at a time, first of all, because we're not that smart to be able to do that. But on a broader trajectory, it does appear fairly much the trend, as we said, which is the hyper cloud guidance will push out in the second half, as I indicated, on the data center side on Tomahawk 4, the 800G platform. In fact, we have substantial backlog for delivering in the back half of the year for Tomahawk 4. So we see that going on. You're right. We see the recovery step by step of the enterprise, though I do not see that really taking off in terms of reaching the level it was a year ago, probably until 2022. But what we do not know for sure is would that give pause to hyper-cloud in their spending. And that part, I'm just putting everything on the table. We're not sure whether hyper-cloud spending will necessarily continue into 2022. We sense it would. We see some of the backlog. But as enterprise steps up, one really never knows if the economy starts to rebalance in that side. But what we do see in broadband is service providers, the telcos, in particular, are, for sure, upgrading. And here, this is the longer cycle of upgrade, and we see them upgrade. And we see the backlog associated with it through 2022."

          "topic": "Lead Time Stability and Booking Rates",
          "content": "I'll just make a comment to say we have stretched out our lead times so far, Ross. Good point you bring up -- and I'm glad you bring it up to give me a chance to clarify a set of quick comments I made in my opening remarks that we are comfortable at the lead times we are on. And so what it is, is customers -- our customers are comfortable seeing our lead time now. But one we have found rather remarkable over the last quarter is that even if our lead times remain stable, consistent, the volume of bookings we receive every week continues to grow. I made that comment and thanks for the opportunity to make that -- reiterate that point. Same lead time, stable for last three months, but the booking rate we are seeing every week continues to step up."

          "topic": "Wireless Demand and Cost Inflation Management",
          "content": "Well, I mean, supply is always something that is very much an issue of constraint in this environment, as you well know. But the other side of the picture is we rallied shipping. As we have said in previous calls several times, to put it directly, we are shipping to exactly, we believe, to what demand requires. By that, I mean, end-user demand requires. We are trying very hard not to over-ship and end up building pockets of excess inventory within our ecosystem. So I think we're managing very much to what we see out there. But we also are always, as I said before a few times, the way we manage our supply chain, we pretty much like to carefully scrutinize a demand as defined by ourselves, which is what -- the end-user who need those products. What we also see, and I mentioned that in our Industrial segment in Q3, where resale from a distributor -- as you know, industrial generally goes through -- pretty much go through distributors. The OEM -- the end-users just go to our distributors and wipe out our inventory, most our inventory there. So we show a resale growth of 55%, and we all know that's not real demand. People are building up buffer. There's a certain level of panic buying. Take that across all segments of semiconductor markets today, you see that kind of behavior unless you -- as core key suppliers, we put in careful discipline to manage supply to where demand is really needed as opposed to where OEMs or even end-users are just building up buffers -- bucket of buffers everywhere. And that's pretty much what we spend a lot of our time doing."

          "topic": "Broadband Growth and Technology Leadership",
          "content": "OK. No, broadband is hot, to cut to the chase. It's hot. It's hot, driven by two things, and I articulated that in my remark: WiFi, WiFi 6. And WiFi is a big area now that operate -- service providers basically operate -- the telcos and cable operators are using, as part of connectivity, to households globally. And that's -- and we have literally won again a huge part of that market successfully. And we're seeing that trend continuing into next-generation WiFi 6e. But what's also driving WiFi -- broadband, I should say, Blayne, and I mentioned that, is fiber. Fiber is multi -- several large telcos, Europe, U.S., are investing very big in putting fiber out there to households. It's particularly driven, I guess, to some extent, by political considerations. They want to connect households very well. You hear about British Telecoms are openly saying they want to -- they have a program over the next five, six years to connect over 20 million British households. Deutsche Telekom is doing exactly the same thing, and so is AT&T here in the U.S., where they have very large program. And these are, as I indicated, multiyear programs, where each of these operators will spend multiple billions of dollars of investment to put that fiber out to the home. And at the end of each node -- fiber node, you have that wireless connectivity, WiFi, within for the last 100 feet in the home. So what I'm implying here is saying, this is not a one-shot thing. And the thinking in the past that fiber is a kind of boring, single-digit slow-growth business, big changes from our perspective because we are seeing the program from those operators coming. And a big part of it is both U.S. and Europe putting in large broadband in the form of fiber because it's the most effective way, in some ways, economic way, to expand to households and hand-in-hand with 5G network wireless networks out there. It's also very interesting for us, market share-wise, because you used to talk about China doing broadband fiber. Today, it's beyond that. It's Europe, U.S. And the number of players fighting in this market on technology is much less now given the interesting political events between China and the rest of the world."

And then as you know, at the end of the year, we're expecting wireless to come back in for the normal ramp that we have. And so the margins will come down a bit toward the end of the year. But at this point, I see us being able to sustain the margins that we experienced this quarter, mostly coming from networking and broadband."

Hock, I'm just kind of curious, you kind of did what you said you were going to do 90 days ago.\n\nBut this is usually the part of the cycle, especially on the semi business, where I would expect -- I would have expected more upside. And clearly, when you look across the sector, most companies are putting up an upside that you guys didn't see in the July quarter. So I'm kind of curious if you can help us better understand what happened. Do you think that this was mostly a supply issue? And given that inventory grew 15% sequentially in the quarter, to what extent do you think now that you're kind of got that under control, and going forward, you'll have a better supply environment to fulfill this demand?"

Can you talk about your capacity -- your ability to get some extra capacity to be able to grow next year? Thank you."

You mentioned it a couple of different times when you were talking about both networking and your server storage connectivity segments. So I guess a two-part question.\n\nOne, how much of your semiconductor business do you believe is enterprise exposed? And two, when do you believe that will return to year-over-year growth? And is that a specific thing to Broadcom with your product cycles? Or is it just the end markets returning to year-over-year growth at that time?"

Last quarter, you were predicting -- or you thought the excellent growth you've seen in cloud server providers and telcos might lighten up next year as they digest that as enterprise started to grow, and there'll be kind of a mix shift there. But it sounds like that isn't lightening up and enterprise is coming back a bit sooner.\n\nDo you think any differently now about telcos and service provider in the cloud? Will that last longer? Do you still expect to maybe lighten up in 2022? And how long do you expect -- enterprise has been down for quite a while now, the enterprise upward trend to last? I'm just trying to get a feeling what the profile of demand looks like in your core business next year. Thanks."

Obviously, while half the cash flow goes to the dividend, the other half goes, I mean, ideally to M&A or buybacks.\n\nAnd it's been a while since, obviously, you executed M&A, and we're kind of getting toward the end of the year. At what point do you kind of make the decision to give up on M&A this year and start buying back stock? Or do you save the cash like for like a potential deal next year? Just how do we think about your mindset around M&A environment versus just using the cash for buybacks? and then maybe starting the cycle over again at some point as we get into next year?"

Hock, I noticed in your prepared script that you were a bit more specific about some of the leadership position that Broadcom has in different levels of advanced SerDes, and you maybe called it out a bit more than you had in the past. It's an advantage the company has had in your own switching routing products, but also in being the ASIC -- preferred ASIC shop for a few hyperscale folks.\n\nI wonder if you might -- did you call that out on purpose? Is there something changing there competitively given the scale of your R&D? Do you feel like that lead is expanding, shrinking, staying the same? Any update there would be great. Thank you."
