          "topic": "Fiscal Year '22 Semiconductor Bookings and Supply Constraints",
          "content": "That's a very good -- hell of a question, I may add. So, let me try to address it in its various component parts. What we continue to see with the recovery, and I made a point of saying that -- and there's now -- we're now in the midst of a very strong spending recovery in enterprise, particularly, so we're continuing to see strong demand bookings in the semiconductor side. But a big part of that demand and increasing part of that demand is now coming from enterprise spending, which translates to end markets, tends to drive a lot of our broadband, continuing to drive the broadband, which has been strong in most of '21, continuing to drive the enterprise part of our networking business. And of course, server storage and industrial is just very, very strong. Having said that, under hyper-cloud spending side, a lot of it resides in, obviously, in our networking business. Things are still fairly very elevated. Demand continues to be strong. And so, when you combine all this together, we continue to see booking rates being at a fairly and continue to be a very elevated level week after week so far. And as of right now, we're pretty much booked all the way through '22 and even beyond '22 into '23. If you think about a 50-week lead time, no surprise, it goes to late '22. But we've gone, even in many cases now, gone beyond '22 and '23. And that's partly because, one, timing of our customers planning very far ahead. And two, as I said, our continuing disciplined approach to ensuring that we deliver products at the right time to the right place, and we see that going on. And I hate to disappoint you, still, we're still not ready or prepared to give you guidance on our whole fiscal year."

          "topic": "Lead Time Stability and Booking Rates",
          "content": "Yes. Well, we've been doing this 50 weeks now for -- just since the beginning of '21. And we have been delivering very much, as much as we can to those lead times. So, in some ways, I'd like to believe it's giving some method to this booking madness, I guess, is what I would call it, in terms of our ability and in terms of where -- how we are shipping the products. But by keeping lead times very stable and predictable as we are doing now, we're also clearly communicating to our end users the way they should be planning their business. And I like to think this -- all this is working out in terms of allowing us to -- making sure we don't over ship and build up buffer inventory through our ecosystem out there, that means distributors, channels, and customers. And all that is being done purposefully. And the truth be told that the day will come when things have to land, and we like to make sure it lands very gently and softly. I would like to think that is working very well. So, what we are reporting in some sectors now, what we're guiding in some sectors, and reporting where you see growth of some 20%, 30%. I know even from our perspective, it seems very hot, excessively hot. And in those areas, in particular, we take strong particular attempt, to make those attempts to ensure these products we ship are for programs that get deployed rather than sit on the shelves for a future need."

          "topic": "Networking Business Outlook for Fiscal '22",
          "content": "Harlan, that's a hell of a question. And only way I can answer that is if this is a way of trying for me -- to guide -- to ask me to guide you on networking for the year ain't working. I'm not doing that. But you're right, though, there are a lot of levers, and I articulate quite a few of them. And maybe I oversay it in some cases. And they all seem to be, as I use the expression, as we sit here today and going into '22, firing on all cylinders. And by that, I mean, more than just forecasting. We've actually seen the backlog. We have the backlog, and they keep building up. And you're right, hyper-cloud guys, like you would ask me six months ago, I would not believe the level of spending they're embarking on right now in '22, but they appear to be. So, we have the rate of enterprise has been strong, and you've seen the rate of growth of enterprise year on year of 30% across broadly. And cloud has the current elevated levels we are seeing in networking has not softened, has not weakened. It's still sustaining. Now it's not recovering, obviously, year-on-year basis as fast as enterprise is showing simply because enterprise starting from a lower point, but cloud is still growing. We are seeing hyper-cloud growing, and it's growing from not just switching and routing. That's our traditional strength. It's growing now for us on -- for want of a better expression, collectively called offload computing applications, from virtualization, orchestration to -- and more and more AI beyond just a single lead customer we have in TPUs today. So, we're seeing multiple as I said, multiple levels, all moving in the right direction for fiscal '22. And good possibility, what we're seeing today in Q1 would run for a large part of fiscal '22."

          "topic": "ASIC Business Growth and Hyper-Cloud Engagement",
          "content": "I think we have continued to be -- to have been spending on R&D in the silicon side on a fairly consistent basis. And so, we have -- but in some other areas, and it's not so much about worrying about competition as seeing the underlying part of our business model across our various franchises. It's simply that we always out-invest our engineer, anybody else in the verticals, in those franchise verticals we are in. And so, from our point of view, hey, now is a great -- because during COVID-19 in '20 and in part of '21, things were not as moving as fast as perhaps we believe a normal cadence of product cycle turnover should be, product life cycle. So, we are now jumping into '22 to basically bring it back up to where it should be in terms of a normal product cycle cadence is. And in that sense, you're right. It's not because of the competition, it's because we believe we need to deliver this new generation of products with better features, better bandwidth, low latency to our customers who are now ready and willing to take it on. And having said that, we invest now. You don't see the impact of that probably until '23, '24. But we feel that there's some hiatus of new technology being absorbed in 2021. So, now is the time to really accelerate new technology, new generation of products for its absorption as much as we could in '22 and definitely in '23. So, it's logical that spending would go up, and we are stepping up for that."

          "topic": "ASIC Business Continuity and Customer Relationships",
          "content": "Right. Thank you for that. And by the way, our ASIC business is actually larger than the $2 billion we indicate. It's only that part of the ASIC business sitting in networking that we highlighted. It's actually -- there are a couple of other areas where we do ASIC and it's done on a platform under one -- in a particular franchise business that we run fairly separately as one of the product divisions. But you are right, though, the larger part of it sits in networking. And a big -- and half of it roughly, I would say, maybe growing more than half now, is to the hyper-cloud is to OEMs too, still remain very much OEM-related business as well. And you're right. But your point is well taken. This is a steady, stable business -- and growing over time that we've had for many, many years. And it has, as I said, a long time ago, 20, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, been very much on networking, merchant silicon showdown in networking and -- which is switching and routing, and it has not grown as much in networking. But in this place, having said that, other opportunities show up. And most of -- a lot of it is what I call collectively offload computing, which is very much tied to hyper-cloud. And that's a business that has been slowly but steadily growing, but it's slow, and it's not something that should slump exponentially overnight. Because a lot of the hyper-cloud guys, much as they have ambition to do their own designs, I'd like to make that point very clear, it's a very difficult thing for them to do because they can go and hire silicon architects and designers, it doesn't mean you can define a chip, sell SoC, silicon on a chip, that addresses what they're looking for. Whether it's in transcoding, whether it's in security or even in virtualization, or even in AI, it's hard when you don't do it on a full-time basis. So we have been working with these hyper-cloud guys for the last five years. There's been fits and starts in many, many situations among these hyper-cloud guys. But the message I want to say is we've never given up. We continue to work with them. And more slowly, more and more, after many tries, some of them become successful, more and more successful, hence you see the trend of growth in our ASIC business for offload computing. I mean, those of you who have followed me consistently for the last three, four, five years, you have heard me talk about it three, four, five years ago. Then two years ago, I just shut up because it takes a while to get it going and starting to translate into revenues and ramps now, and it will be a nice driver to growth, I believe, for us over the next year, two years, I would say. So, I'm bringing it back up again. But it's always been there."

          "topic": "Wireless Business Performance and Content Opportunities",
          "content": "Wireless is a great franchise, and it continues to chug along very well. And that's probably -- I'm definitely wearing rose-tinted glasses in this environment because demand is good and it's holding up still very well. Beyond that, I really don't know the answer to what you're saying. I do see content increasing over the next several years because we have various products, multiple products, not just one particular product. And we have multiple -- we have various products into every one of those very high-end smartphones, and that gives us opportunity to expand footprint and to strengthen and increase our content. We never really plan for unit increases actually in all our plan. We just plan on some content increase year after year, but never on any unit increase. So, I guess I don't -- I stop thinking or worrying about whether the number of phones is going to decline in 5G in the next one or two years as much as would the content decline from -- and we have not really seen it on -- in any fashion that would make us worry."

Hock, I know you guys don't guide for the full year, but I was hoping you could kind of walk us through how you're thinking about fiscal year '22 on the semiconductor side. Obviously, bookings have been strong, continue to be strong across most of your buckets or end markets within semis. But if you can talk about bookings trends in the quarter, what you're seeing there, that would be super helpful. And then as you sort of answer the fiscal '22 question, if you can touch on supply and to what extent supply could be a gating factor over the next 12 months, that would be helpful. Thank you."

It sounds like your bookings overall is very strong. At the same time, we know you've been taking efforts to limit like worries around stockpiling and over shipping, whether it's parsing orders, expedites. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are doing in that space. How are you feeling right now in terms of your shipments versus where end demand is? And how meaningful those like long, with 50-plus-week lead times actually are? Do they actually represent demand even if it's that far out? Like if you could just talk about your efforts there, that would be helpful."

        "questions": "Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. Hock, on your networking business, you've been somewhat conservative on your view on the sustainability of the strong cloud and hyperscale growth, but yet in cloud, I mean, you guys are ramping seven-nanometer Tomahawk 4 and Trident 4. They're in the early innings of the ramp. Demand is strong. You talked about Jericho and Qumran being strong in routing. Your cloud ASIC customers ramping their seven-nanometer TPU, and you have more programs firing next year, as you mentioned. And then on the enterprise side, your large enterprise OEM customers are benefiting from the strong recovery. So, you're starting off the fiscal year in networking with strong double-digits growth, but do you see your networking business continuing to drive double-digits year-over-year growth for the full year? And will the growth be driven by all three of your end markets, cloud, enterprise, and service provider?"

        "questions": "Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the strong results and the guidance. So, Hock, I find two things interesting. One is you didn't use the word metaverse in your commentary, but that's not my question. The question is on the buyback announcement. What changed your view? Because for some time, you were not as favorable toward buybacks. So, the $10 billion announcement, is that more a statement about business trends, is it lack of M&A targets? Are you going to be more consistent in buybacks? So, that's part A of the question. And part B is that, if I take that $6 billion or $7 billion in dividends that you will pay next year and add the $10 billion in buybacks and apply the free cash flow range that you have, it suggests sales of somewhere in the low to mid-30s billion, right, using that math. And I know you're not giving a guidance, but does that math makes sense? Thank you."

So, first, Hock, I want to revisit kind of the quality of demand and maybe ask it a different way. You've talked about under shipping what the actual demand or what your bookings are because you believe you can ship to actual demand. So, that delta between what you're shipping and what is being booked, is that changing? Is it shrinking, growing? Basically, trying to get at any change in customer behavior. And then the second question would be separate and one for Kirsten. You mentioned about the opex in the semiconductor side rising going forward. Any more color about the linearity of opex as we go throughout the year? And any color on kind of the areas that would be focuses of that investment?"

        "questions": "Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question, and congratulations on the strong results. Hock, maybe just a follow-on to Ross' question about the R&D commentary that Kirsten had in the prepared comments. With the growth that you're expecting in the semi R&D, do you think that that will outstrip the semiconductor revenue growth for the year or not? And not having had the time yet to go back and look, is this an unusual spend here? And if so, what's driving it? Is it concern about increased competition? Is it the opportunity set getting a lot bigger? And kind of what areas are you focused on? And then I have a follow-up. And then as my follow-up, Hock, you guys have set up a really consistent track record around the dividend. The buybacks have been a little bit more episodic, especially given the M&A strategy. Just with the authorization today, is the intent to do all of that within the next 12 months? Why not an ASR component around that authorization today just to give investors confidence that you will follow through on the buyback?"

I think you said it's roughly 20% of the networking business and also said it's going to be about $2 billion. I'm just curious if you could maybe provide us some additional color as to what's going on with that business. I mean, you've been a leader in this market historically. And are you seeing more interest given what's going on with the hyperscale customers and their interest in developing in-house silicon? Or is this a continuation of a trend? Or any additional color you could provide, I think that would be helpful. And then just to follow up on wireless, Hock. Obviously, the current demand looks healthy, and supply is very tight. But I guess if you take maybe a couple of your view out there, it looks like there's somewhat of a concern about 5G cycle peaking. So, I'm just curious about how you're thinking about wireless, especially in terms of your content opportunities for the next couple of years? Thank you."

So, I guess the question really is around, are you seeing any change in the portion of customers that want product inside a lead time and are willing to pay your expedite fees? And I guess does that sort of inform you to the degree to which your shipments or the orders are sort of matching underlying consumption? And then I had a second question, too. And then I guess the last question really is around wireless. And now that you're into December, you should, I think, have a pretty good handle on how much your content is going to grow for fiscal '22. So, I was just wondering if you can sort of give us a sense of maybe how much content is growing. Is it growing, say, let's say, 10% this year type of thing? Thank you."
