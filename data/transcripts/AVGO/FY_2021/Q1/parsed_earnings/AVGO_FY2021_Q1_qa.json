          "content": "Well, it's a very interesting question, a very, very appropriate question at this time. And as I say, we have had as I indicated, we started this process almost 9 months ago because we were seeing demand that is quite strong. We started the process of thinking about how we best ensure very, very good use of our supply chain capacity. We went through this process rigorously scrubbing our backlog.\n\nOur entire backlog virtually follows a key set of terms we mentioned before, which is non-cancelable for any of our customers who booked us, and they still apply, more so than ever. So double bookings from our point of view are not and they've never been an issue. As we stretch our lead times, we are seeing customers book for delivery dates that are further out, which makes sense.\n\nThis allows us to match customer consumption closely against what we supply. We feel pretty good that we have a reasonable process in place that ensures our customers get the products when they need them. Our revenue year-on-year in Q1 was up 17%, and our bookings were up 63%, proving strong demand. We are virtually 90% booked for 2021, reflecting real and sustainable demand."

          "content": "Yes, we have done a decent job. Over the last 6 months, and we continue to do so, we've been able to meet the critical needs of all our customers. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities have been expanded to handle the seasonal upcycle in the back half of the wireless business. This ensures that we have the capacity to drive higher revenues in the July and October quarters, assuming our backlog supports that profile."

          "content": "On the latter part, yes, it is an outer year. This thing doesn't get implemented so fast. And on the formal part of your question, I can't answer that, I'm sorry. For obvious reasons, it's too early. We will tell you about it when the time is appropriate. Thank you."

        {
          "topic": "Supply and Demand Imbalance Outlook",
          "content": "Another way to answer that question, John, is when do you see lead time reduce or normalize. Right now, I don't know the answer to that. We have extended lead times over the past several months and continue to do so. We are getting bookings from customers, and when those bookings start to disappear, that's when demand may start to decline. We have not reached that point yet."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Software Bookings and Revenue Growth Confidence",
          "content": "Yes. As I indicated in my prepared remarks on some of the key metrics we go by, we feel very, very good about those two. We are focusing on core customers and uplifting capacity, entitlements, and products across our portfolio. On non-core areas, we see a manageable level of attrition, which is offset by improvement in the core, allowing us to reach stabilization around mid-single digits consistently. Our enterprise customers continue to consume our products, especially in this pandemic environment."

        {
          "topic": "Wireless Orders and Seasonality Impact",
          "content": "Tim, bookings started ramping up as early as Q3, shot up in Q4, and started declining in late Q4 and Q1. Q1 bookings showed an 80% year-on-year improvement, netting out a decline in wireless bookings as expected seasonally. The revenue reflects this, with declining wireless bookings offset by strong performance in other segments."

        {
          "topic": "Networking Growth and Demand Sustainability",
          "content": "Yes, great question. People need our products across all our end markets. Whether it's broadband, networking, or cloud scaling, our customers require our products to launch more broadband and improve their networks. They are willing to book products 6 to 8 months out to reserve capacity, indicating strong and mission-critical demand. This is not a panic mode but a structured and reasonable process reflecting real underlying demand."

          "topic": "Gross Margins and Operating Expenses",
          "content": "In Q1, our gross margins were up by 30 basis points year-over-year, largely due to wireless. For Q2, we will have fewer wireless revenues in the margin mix, so you should look back at Q4 to model Q2 margins. As the year progresses, margins will reflect more normal seasonality in wireless for the second half."

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, some good color on the supply side of the equation and a little bit about your lead times extending. I wanted to dive a little bit into that.\n\nLast quarter, you talked about a backlog? I think the number was $14 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of your backlog today? How is it an absolute level and the sustainability of it as investors are wondering if this demand is just too good to be sustainable? And what does it mean to excess bookings, double ordering, that sort of inventory digestion that will inevitably follow thereafter?"

        "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, the biggest concern by investors right now is your ability to drive growth in the seasonally stronger second half of your fiscal year, your July and October quarters, when you start to ramp into your flagship smartphone customers, if I just apply normal seasonal trends in wireless combined with let's say sustained networking strength and as you mentioned recovery and storage, that would get me revenues in the second half in that sort of $6.77 billion range. And now, I'm not asking you to endorse those numbers, but I guess the question is, from a supply chain perspective has the team secured enough capacity to drive higher revenues in July and October quarter if your backlog supported that profile?"

        "Thanks for taking my question. Hock, you mentioned you expected this 30%, 40% kind of year-on-year growth rates in wireless to sustain in the back half. I was hoping if you could give us some color on what kind of content growth you are expecting this year? And then looking forward, how much does Broadcom benefit from all these C band spectrum auctions that were conducted recently. I assume that's more of an outer year benefit."

        "Yeah, thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, I just want to get back to the supply demand imbalance. You did a very good job kind of explaining how you guys are trying to call your backlog. I'm kind of curious, as you look out over the next couple of quarters, when do you think supply will catch up to demand enough, such as your customers don't feel obligated to have to build that cushion?"

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So Hock, you're saying that you're stretching out lead times. I get it, but I think before you told us the lead times were 6 months.\n\nSo if you're stretching them out, where are they actually sitting today? And how does that maybe vary by end market? And I guess to that end, you said, you're kind of convinced that what you're shipping now sort of represents end-user consumption. How do you actually have any visibility into that? And do you think the users, I mean, are the products actually going into end products? How do you know the users aren't stockpiling them and ordering them while they can? How do you have any visibility into what's they're doing with them?"

Now that you have Symantec for a year and CA for a couple of years, can you just talk about the confidence of the growth rates on a longer-term basis that you're talking about? I know you touched on the 90% recurring, which is really how the global large accounts are kind of -- how that transition is playing out?"

        "Hi. Thanks a lot. I guess, I also had a question on the supply demand. Hock, orders obviously were up quite a bit in fiscal Q1, Q on Q, given that revenue was up in backlog, I think you said was up significantly.\n\nSo as you look into fiscal Q2, wireless orders are obviously going to come down a lot. So, I'm wondering if orders in the other parts of the business are going to be strong enough such that total orders will be up in fiscal Q2. Again, thanks."

The dividend component is pretty predictable, but outside of the dividend, how are you thinking about paying down debt, buying back stock, and M&A and software. The markets are clearly very volatile right now, but how are you thinking about those three buckets on a relative basis? Thank you."

We don't have the right comparison year over year.\n\nSo maybe if you just give us a little color as to what you're expecting. I just don't know what that 30% to 40% year over a year really kind of compares to. So maybe just some just color as to what you're seeing from that wireless channel versus normal seasonal patterns that would help us kind of dial in as to what you're really saying for April."

        "Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess wanted to dig a little into your EBITDA margin guide.\n\nIt would suggest that either gross margins are flat, which would not seem likely given the fall-off in wireless or optics is moving higher. Can you kind of walk through the moving parts there? And as part of that, can you help us understand how to model gross margins and opex through the remainder of the fiscal year? Thank you."

I'm trying to wrap my head around some stunning numbers you threw out for networking, 80% increase in bookings, some 62% odd sequential increase. I appreciate the process of identifying real demand. So with that, is there something going on in bookings that is specific to your end markets or your product set that is driving it? Could you just highlight what is going on there?"

        "Your wireless business is booming, obviously, on the 5G release with your largest customer, but maybe we can talk about a little bit longer term. There's no secret, your largest customers' largest initiative is to do their own baseband modem. And I mean that's a job unto itself.\n\nThe interface, the entire RF front end, has to usually be designed by somebody other than the baseband guys. That's the case for all baseband providers now. In fact, most baseband from MediaTek to Qualcomm are turning to the incumbents, the large RF semi companies, to do the actual architecture design itself. Since you are the strategic partner for the largest portion of that, is it fair to assume that you will be intimately involved in this? And does that change the nature of your relationship in terms of revenue growth or margins? Because this is a once in a company history event for your largest customer, if they can get it working, they're going to need all the help they can get.\n\nSo how does this affect the margin profile and, more importantly, the revenue growth over the next two, three years in wireless?"
