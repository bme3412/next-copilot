          "content": "OK. Let me take the question one at a time. On arrangements with long-term agreements, John, this is something we have been thoughtfully, carefully putting in place with our core strategic customers. We just don't go do it as if it's commoditized. We're very thoughtful about doing it, and we do it in very specific areas where we know for sure that the technology is fairly, fairly difficult, complex to manage and which requires a substantial amount of R&D spending. And we've been doing it for a while now with strategic customers in core businesses. So we just don't do it across the board. And what you pointed out is very, very correct. It's a mutual structure, it's an agreement with mutual benefit. We have the confidence to invest in R&D to make capex capacity investment. And in return, we offer the best leading-edge technology in specific areas in a timely manner to our critical customers. So yes, we have been doing it, and we will continue to thoughtfully do it in a very appropriate manner."

          "topic": "Enterprise Recovery and Spending Trends",
          "content": "It is across -- it is for enterprise spending. I won't say across the board necessarily and trying to define enterprise very appropriately. As you noticed in my comments, we've classified service providers, telcos as a separate animal, different from traditional enterprise. And as I pointed out, based on broadband, telcos have been investing big time. Service providers, telcos have been investing in a huge manner over the past 12 months. But traditional enterprise, the companies, whether it's the banks, the manufacturing sector, various retail customers, airlines, examples, no, these guys are in a recovery mode. And not surprising, we are seeing pandemic easing like, say, in North America. And as it eases, we see a step-up in spending. But we do not see spending spiking up. Now, obviously, if you look at some businesses like warehouses that require WiFi networks, campus networking environment, you do see that improving. But to say across the board, all enterprises are just spending money, we are still seeing -- and as I showed that in server storage connectivity, we still see year on year, things are not up to what it was a year ago. And that applies not just on data centers, namely compute. It also applies to data centers in enterprise, campus environment. We see less of that but across the board."

          "topic": "Networking Growth and Customer Demand Sustainability",
          "content": "We don't really try to guide more than one quarter at a time, first of all, because we're not that smart to be able to do that. But on a broader trajectory, it does appear fairly much the trend, as we said, which is the hyper cloud guidance will push out in the second half, as I indicated, on the data center side on Tomahawk 4, the 800G platform. In fact, we have substantial backlog for delivering in the back half of the year for Tomahawk 4. So we see that going on. You're right. We see the recovery step by step of the enterprise, though I do not see that really taking off in terms of reaching the level it was a year ago, probably until 2022. But what we do not know for sure is would that give pause to hyper-cloud in their spending. And that part, I'm just putting everything on the table. We're not sure whether hyper-cloud spending will necessarily continue into 2022. We sense it would. We see some of the backlog. But as enterprise steps up, one really never knows if the economy starts to rebalance in that side. But what we do see in broadband is service providers, the telcos, in particular, are, for sure, upgrading. And here, this is the longer cycle of upgrade, and we see them upgrade. And we see the backlog associated with it through 2022."

          "topic": "Lead Time Stability and Booking Rates",
          "content": "I'll just make a comment to say we have stretched out our lead times so far, Ross. Good point you bring up -- and I'm glad you bring it up to give me a chance to clarify a set of quick comments I made in my opening remarks that we are comfortable at the lead times we are on. And so what it is, is customers -- our customers are comfortable seeing our lead time now. But one we have found rather remarkable over the last quarter is that even if our lead times remain stable, consistent, the volume of bookings we receive every week continues to grow. I made that comment and thanks for the opportunity to make that -- reiterate that point. Same lead time, stable for last three months, but the booking rate we are seeing every week continues to step up."

          "topic": "Wireless Demand and Cost Inflation Management",
          "content": "All right. Let's start with the first one. And if I lost track of the last two, you better remind me. But on wireless, you're right. What I indicated was Q2 wireless was kind of higher than we had originally planned, and a lot related to demand. Of course, it's demand. We will never ship just because we have the products. It's based on demand, wanting it, and so we're happy to fulfill it. And part of the demand may actually come a bit from Q3. Not sure 100% yet because this is -- demand comes in short cycles. And it may, and perhaps that's why we are a bit careful about telling you Q3 year-on-year improvement is still 30-plus percent year-on-year growth. I'm not saying 40%-plus. But we don't know for sure, except we know that we do pull in some from Q3 to Q2, not much, and that allows Q2 to perform that 48% year-on-year growth, which is great. But Q3 will still be pretty good year on year, as we fully expect. And related to content and all that, I prefer, at this point in this sensitive arena with a highly sensitive situation, to not answer that question at all. No offense, please, but I can't answer that question. But I'll be happy to take the third question, which is, yes, we have cost inflation in this environment where, as we all know, the semiconductor supply chain is on a severe constraint on its ability to provide. Now we are very large. We are a very, very large customer and a very loyal customer to many of our suppliers, all of our key components. And so we believe we are treated very well. Having said that, where prices are concerned, of course not. We see cost inflation. And in this environment, we are very, very open to talking to our customers who are, in turn, very open to being able to address inflationary cost pressure in a higher purchase price on your side. So we're good, which is why our margin has been stable."

          "content": "Yeah. I'll take that one. This is Kirsten. Relative to capital allocation, first and foremost, we're dedicated to paying 50% of our free cash flows to our shareholders. And so that would be first. Secondly, M&A, if we can -- accretive M&A, it would be the second objective. Then thirdly, stock buybacks, and at the end, there would be debt repayments. So I think that's how we're looking at capital allocation in that order. There isn't anything yet on the M&A front that I can talk about. But if anything does come up, we'll let you know."

And then as you know, at the end of the year, we're expecting wireless to come back in for the normal ramp that we have. And so the margins will come down a bit toward the end of the year. But at this point, I see us being able to sustain the margins that we experienced this quarter, mostly coming from networking and broadband."

        "Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I've got two quick ones.\n\nFirst, within your wireless business, you've been able to sign long-term contracts with your key customer, and I'd argue that's benefited both you and them. It's given you the confidence to invest in the business properly and then the confidence that you'll have supply for them when they need it. I'm just kind of curious, given how tight things are elsewhere in the semi business, have you been able to parlay this into any longer-term customer contracts? And what implications might that have as we all start to worry about the 'end of cycle'? And then secondly, just on your comments about enterprise recovery, can you elaborate on that? Was that specifically a storage comment? Or is that also a networking comment?"

        "Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution, strong margins, and free cash flow generation. Hock, I think as you mentioned, we're still in the early phases of the 400-gig networking upgrade cycle with your hyperscale and telco customers. I know two of your big cloud typing customers have already started the upgrade.\n\nIt looks like there's another two more that are going to start the upgrade cycle here in the second half of this year and quite a bit more next year. And then as you mentioned, you still have Tomahawk 4 ahead of you. So given the extended visibility that the team has with the strong backlog, do you see the cloud and telco upgrade cycle and inevitable recovery in enterprise driving continued year-over-year growth in networking into next year?"

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for having me ask a question. Congrats on the strong results. Hock, I want to dive a little bit into the lead time commentary that you had with that stabilizing.\n\nTwo quarters ago, you talked about the size of the book, the backlog you had. Last quarter, you talked about the year over year and even, in some instances, the sequential growth being so large in bookings. And now we're hearing that the lead times are stabilizing. People could interpret that a bunch of different ways as far as the implication on the demand side of the equation or that supply is catching up to it, or frankly, people are just ordering so far out that they're not willing to extend that any further.\n\nSo I was hoping to double-click on that lead time commentary and get your feelings as to why it's stabilizing. And do you take that as a positive or a negative?"

And kind of part B of that is, what is driving the shortages for you right now? And what are you doing to resolve it? And do you have any kind of gut feel on when the supply situation will become normal? Thank you."

        "Thanks. Hock, I guess I wanted to ask you what you think the long-term growth rate is of your semiconductor business. You're sort of trending to the high teens this year, but that's kind of due to easy comps and you have the compressed iPhone launch and the pull forward of some of these technologies due to the pandemic. So once this all sort of normalizes, what do you think is the right long-term growth rate for the business? Are you still thinking 5%? Or do you think maybe just given the strength of the bookings recently that it could be better than that? Thanks."

      "questions": [
        "Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I had two actually, one on wireless and one on the cost side. Hock, in terms of wireless, I guess in Q2, revenue came in better than expected.\n\nI just wanted to understand, was that primarily supply being better? Or were there dynamics on the demand side that came in better than expected? And then sticking to wireless, as you think about the next-generation product cycle at your largest customer, how are you thinking about the content opportunity at this point? You pretty much know what's locked in. If you can comment on RF and WiFi and maybe compare and contrast this uplift in this cycle vis-a-vis past cycles, that would be super helpful. And then on the cost side, based on the comments you just made about gross margin expansion and some of Kirsten's comments, I doubt cost inflation is having impact on your business. But if you can speak to wafer pricing and substrates and what you're seeing from a cost perspective over the next year or so, that would be super helpful."

And then I guess as you look forward here, if you could describe what you're still dealing with in terms of excess costs due to COVID and then how to think about it as enterprise comes back.\n\nShould that be additive to the gross margin?"
