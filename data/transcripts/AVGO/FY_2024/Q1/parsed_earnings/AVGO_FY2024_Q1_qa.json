It has been very successful so far. And I agree it's early innings still at this point. We just have closed on the deal -- well, we closed on the deal late November, and we are now March, early March.\n\nSo, we had the benefit of at least three months, but we have been very prepared to launch and focus on this push initiative on private cloud, VCF. And the results has been very much what we expect it to be, which is very, very successful."

Yes, the increase, as we have said before as we shown before, it's roughly two-thirds, one-third or 70-30, which is AI celebrators which are custom ASIC AI celebrate this. We've a couple of hyperscalers compared to compared to the other components, which are collectively considered as networking components.\n\nAnd it's about 70%-30% mix. And that increase of almost $3 billion that you mentioned, it's a similar combination."

          "topic": "AI Compute and Networking Demand",
          "content": "Yeah. No, our Tomahawk 5 is going great guns. Now it's not driven unlike in the past, Tomawak 3, Tomawak 4 by traditional scale-out in hyperscalers on their cloud environment. This is all largely coming from a scaling out of AI data centers.\n\nThe building of larger and larger clusters to enable generative AI computing functionality. And you're going for bigger and bigger pipes. Hence, the Tomahawk 5 51-terabit is a perfect solution, and we're seeing a lot of demand. And in many cases, we are basically, they are surpassing the rate of adoption that we had previously thought.\n\nSo, it is a very good solution in connecting GPUs. And with respect to AI accelerators where I think you are focusing on, is that a constraint on supply chain. We do get enough lead time out of our hyperscale customers that we do not have a supply chain constraint."

          "content": "I think now we've got. We are spending more on go-to-market and support because we have a lot of customers with VMware.\n\nThey are 300,000, but we stratify. So, we have the strategic guys. We sell, upsell VC private cloud very good. But the long tail of what we call smaller commercial customers, we continue to support and sell improved versions of just vSphere compute virtualization to improve productivity on their service.\n\nWe don't attempt to say, go build up your whole VCM. They don't have the skills, don't have the scale to do it. But only, it adds up. You're right.\n\nCosts of my spend, opex spend, be it support services, go-to-market, will increase. But the difference between that and, say, CA, MAI, and the acquisition we did, is we're growing this business very fast. And you don't have to increase your spend growing this business. So, we have operating leverage through revenue growth over the next three years."

And I add to it like most things we do in terms of large critical technology products. We tend to always have, as we do here, a very deep strategic and multiyear relationship with our customer."

          "content": "Well, number one, we don't dominate this market. I only have two. They can be dominating it, too, and -- number one. Number two, the second point is very -- it takes years.\n\nIt takes a lot of heavy lifting to create that custom silicon because you need to do more than just hardware of silicon to really have a solution for generative AI or even AI in trying to create those AI capabilities in our data centers. It's more than just silicon. You have to invest a lot in creating software models that works on your custom silicon that matches. You've got to match your business model in the first place, which leads to and create foundation models which then needs to work and optimize on the custom silicon you are developing.\n\nSo, it's an iterative process. and it's a constant evolving process even for the same customer we deal with. I mentioned that in the last call. So, it takes years to really understand or to be able to basically reach a point where you can say that, hey, I'm finally delivering production worthy -- and it's not because silicon is bad.\n\nIt's because it doesn't work well with the foundation models that the customer put in place and a software layer that works with it, the firmware, the software layer that translates into it. All that has to work you are almost like creating an entire ecosystem on -- in a limited basis, which we are recognized very well in x86 CPUs, but in GPUs, those kind of AI accelerators is something still very early stage. So, it takes years. And for our two customers, we have engaged for years.\n\nWith one of them, we have engaged for eight years to get to this point. So, it's something you have to be very patient, persevere, and hope that everything lines up because ultimate success, if you are just a silicon developer, it's not just dependent on you, but dependent as much even more on your partner or customer doing it. So, just got to be patient, guys. I got the two only so far."

          "content": "I have no interest in going into a market where -- we have a philosophy in running our business, Broadcom. And maybe other people have a different philosophy. Let me tell you my simple philosophy, which I've articulated over time, every now and then, which is very clear to my management team and to the whole Broadcom.\n\nYou do what you're good at. And you do -- you keep doubling down on things you know you are better than anybody else. And you just keep doubling down because nobody else will catch up to you if you keep running in of the pack. But do not do something that you think you can do, but somebody else is doing much better job than you are.\n\nThat's my philosophy."

          "content": "I'll take that because you're asking business model, you're not asking really number crunching. So, let me try to answer in this way. No, there's no particular reason shot of what constitutes an AI accelerator. An AI accelerator, the way it's configured now, whether it's a merchant or its customer has a -- for AI accelerator to run foundation models very well.\n\nNot just a whole bunch of loads of floating-point multipliers to do matrix multiplication, matrix analysis on regression. That's the logic part, compute part. It comes -- you have to come with access to a lot of memory, literally almost cash memory tied to it. The chip is not just a simple multiplier.\n\nIt has -- it comes attached to memory. It's almost a layer three-dimensional chip, which it is. Memory is not something we -- any of us in AI accelerators are super good at designing or building. So, we buy the memory from very specialized high-bandwidth memory, you all know about that, from key memory suppliers.\n\nEvery one of us does that. So, you parted combine the two together, that's what an AI accelerator is. So, even if I get very good net corporate silicon gross margin on mine compute, logic chip on multipliers. There's no way I can apply that kind of add-on margin to the high-bandwidth memory, which is a big part of the cost of the total chip.\n\nAnd so, naturally, by simple math, it will -- that hold an entire consolidated AI accelerator brings a gross margin below on a traditional silicon product we have out there. Now going away from that because you are adding on memory, even though we have to create the excess, the IOs that attach in, we do not and could not justify adding that kind of margin to memory, Nobody could, for us. So, it brings a natural lower margin. That's really the simple basis to it.\n\nBut on the logic part of it, sure, with the kind of content with the kind of IP that we develop cutting edge to make those high-density floating-point multipliers on 800 square millimeters of advanced silicon we can command the margin similar to our corporate gross margin."
