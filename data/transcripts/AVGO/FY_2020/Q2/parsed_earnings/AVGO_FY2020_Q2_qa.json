We definitely -- as you know and which you are implying to in your question, we are designing obviously in those flagship -- big flagship phones in our large North American OEM phone makers. We are, there is no question. The question is the timing. And you're right. In the past years, seasonally -- the business is seasonal and the trough of every fiscal year has been Q2. We believe, because of product cycle delays, the trough for our fiscal year will be Q3, this coming quarter. And that's why we reflected -- in our forecast that's reflected in our number and in the way we are guiding Q3."

We now have CA under our belt and CA comprises mainframe and distributed software as well, especially the whole range from desktops to business operation platforms. And answer to -- given that we have almost a year and a half of CA under our belt, we're very, very pleased with that acquisition. It has -- performance -- financial performance of CA has exceeded even our regional plan when we did the deal 18 months ago."

          "content": "You're right. We sell a fairly broad range of products even into data centers. And as I indicated, we sell networking products switching. We also sell server storage components, server storage connectivity and we also sell some of these components into hard drives that go into those nearline cloud datacenters. So its broad diversity and the impact, the challenges and constraints on a supply chain cuts across some of these products, not all consistently. But we basically see very, very strong demand and our challenge is to be able to optimize how we are supplying in those situations."

          "topic": "End Market Demand and Channel Inventory Management",
          "content": "Yeah, talking about -- I assume the original equipment manufacturers, the OEMs. Now most of the OEMs, not all, who buy from us, tend to, as you probably are implying here, buying a lot for enterprises, more of the traditional enterprise side. And as we see over the past 12, 13 weeks, which represents one quarter of bookings we are seeing, a lot of the OEMs are also buying for those enterprises. So -- and on the basis that which we do scrutinize where those orders come from and a lot of these orders are also for demand from fairly large enterprise customers that these guys have."

        {
          "topic": "Demand Strength and Direct Orders",
          "content": "Well, let me turn to [Phonetic] answer that. First and foremost most of all these orders, all these big demand constraint we're talking about are direct -- are orders directly from the end users, most of them. These are -- a lot of it is what we all have heard about strength in the cloud. Mega scale cloud vendors are buying it. Strength in broadband from -- directly from the telcos, the service providers. We are getting the most -- a lot of these customers we deal with directly. And even if they go through OEMs, not distributors, OEMs, we have clear visibility on pools from end users which are the customers of the OEMs like the telcos, the cable companies, service providers. So these are all largely direct."

          "content": "Stacy, it's Tom. I think there is no correlation between what we talked about earlier this year and where we are today. The reality is -- what we see is content is up as talked about 40%. There's been a shift in terms of when product is going to be delivered. There are some supply chain constraints, of course, on top of that."

          "content": "Let me take the first part which is in this environment, given where everything is we're focused on running the business, we're focused on liquidity, we're focused on our capital returns. I think at least for the time being, M&A is off the table until visibility improves. That's all -- that's all to say there."

          "topic": "Symantec Integration and Revenue Ramp",
          "content": "Sure. It's Tom. Things are progressing well. It's a unique deal, it's an asset purchase we took the decision to drive integration quickly. We're well ahead from an operating expense standpoint. And so I think by and large, we're off to a decent start. On the revenue side relative to CA, Symantec had a bit more on the -- in the form of perpetual licenses. When we bought the business over we did take a purchase accounting haircut, which is reflected in the numbers. We also successfully sold the managed services business, we're getting set to close that with Accenture. So that's a good thing. And so what I think you'll see is as bookings continue to come online and we move into not only the second quarter, but in the second half, we will continue to progress toward the $1.8 billion run rate that we articulated last quarter."

        "Hock, the question is on wireless. Historically, you see some of that growth in Q3 from a seasonal perspective and then a larger growth in Q4. This time you're saying it's going to be shifted by a quarter. And then I think in the past you've also mentioned strong, I think, 30% kind of content growth when it comes to 5G. So the question is, how should we think about the wireless recovery in Q4? And if you could help us kind of align it whether it can be up year-on-year or flattish year-on-year? Just give us some more color around how we should think about the wireless expected recovery into Q4. Thank you."

        "Hock, I just want to go back to your comments about some of the supply constraints you saw in the fiscal second quarter and expect to see in the fiscal third quarter. Is there any way to quantify the revenue impact? And I guess specifically why I'm asking, while the sequential growth in network, up 11%, in the fiscal second quarter is solid, at least by our math on a year-over-year basis, it's only up about kind of mid to high teens, which is kind of significantly underperforming a lot of the other cloud semi guys that have reported. And so I'm just trying to square that circle. And were the supply constraints more dominated in a certain part of the business?"

        "I want to piggyback off John's question and maybe look a little further forward on the supply side with the constraint. Hock you mentioned that that was going to be a limitation in the third quarter and also could even go into the fourth quarter. Is the specifics of it enough away from wireless that if you're pushing out the wireless business and you're still short of supply that when that wireless business comes back, are you going to have even bigger problems and have to make sacrifices elsewhere? Or are those supply chain sufficiently differentiated that you can have the wireless side come back and not have to have make any sacrifices on the rest of the business when we look into fiscal 4Q?"

        "Given the sharp COVID-19 related increase in compute and data traffic, I can understand the strength in the cloud data center business and obviously the requirements to add more networking capacity. Not sure that this dynamic actually goes away even as global geographies start to open back up.\n\nAnd then Hock as you mentioned, on top of that, you guys are ramping Tomahawk 3, Jericho 2, some of your compute acceleration ASICs. So given all of this, do you see sustainability of demand for your cloud products into the second half of the year because there seems to be a view out there that post COVID-19 cloud customers are going to take a pause in the second half of the year."

        "I wanted to go back to wireless. In the press release, you used the word expected substantial reset. So does that mean that the product delay was expected or was that expected a reference to the semi custom business that we knew was rolling off that you had told us a couple of quarters ago? I think it's going from $1.1 billion last year, like $500 million this year.\n\nAnd more generally two quarters ago, you gave some wireless growth targets for the year. I think it was down about 10% for the full year. I assume you're tracking below that now given what's going on. But can you give us some order of magnitude idea of how the wireless business is actually tracking right now versus the color that you had given us two quarters ago for what to expect this time [Phonetic]."

So I'm assuming you're talking just cellular and that's just some portion of the mix. And then -- so I'm assuming that that will flow in the model over the next couple of years. Maybe you can just give us a perspective on Wi-Fi as well as the kind of composite content story over the next couple of years in wireless."

I think Hock you used the word surge recently. So how do you handicap the demand strength?\n\nIs sell-through sufficient to support the orders or are we maybe routing them [Phonetic] in future quarters given that the customers know that there is some supply constraints and maybe routing from the end of the year into 2021? I guess, I'm sort of asking if you can bridge sell-in and what you're hearing from your customers on sell-through."
