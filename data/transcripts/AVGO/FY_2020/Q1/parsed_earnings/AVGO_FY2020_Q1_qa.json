But suffice it to say, and we put that out in our -- in the press release when -- right after we signed agreement with our customer that basically it's a long term -- a three-year, in fact, agreement that aligns -- that requires us to provide technology and road map alignment in essentially RF components for the next three years -- next three generation of 5G phones. And it's a very close engagement and it's perpetuates the strong products and franchise we have in this space."

I mean as we sit here right now and obviously trying not to be disingenuous about how we answer this question, but we haven't seen any significant or meaningful impact. But that could reflect the fact that most of all our businesses are related to enterprises and infrastructure as opposed to consumer base. And as we know the pandemic of COVID-19 is obviously hitting the people, the individual, the consumer. So we have that level of buffer before we see it and we recognize that. We also recognize the fact that probably some areas would behave differently from other areas in the sense that we see as part of social distancing that more and more people -- a lot of people work from home, which basically implies they not only work from home, they stay home and play from whom, which means consumption of Internet cloud increases."

So you are looking at a very limited horizon and a little bit of visibility because the bookings are only of a certain period of time. We're not talking of bookings that run down to the end of this calendar year. We don't book that far ahead. So on that limited horizon of bookings we are seeing in a -- it's what is not discernible, another way of my phrasing it is any significant change in the way the pattern of booking we've been seeing over the past couple of months also. That has not changed. Neither have we seen any cancellations, that's what I mean, on the orders that have -- on any of the backlog there have been placed on those -- on our books today. That's as much as I would put it at this point."

So, yeah, that's a nice -- in a way that's a very nice thing about having this slug of infrastructure software within our product portfolio."

I think if you look at the Q2 levels, it's a seasonally down quarter traditionally and if we work off of that as a baseline, you're right, we all would have expected revenues to seasonally be up in the second half. There are some one-time drivers associated with that, but there's also generally an uptick in the back half. We run a lot of different scenarios, as you would expect, we would. Even if you assume depressed levels where we're flattish off of the Q2 number, I mean, keep in mind, in Q2 we're going to generate on the order of $2.5 billion of free cash flow, interest rates have come down dramatically. We have a lot of floating rate debt that's helping us. We have a variable compensation structure here as Hock was articulating that helps us."

I think on the leverage levels what we had gone into the year looking at was maintaining roughly 3 to 3.5 times leverage on a pro forma basis with Symantec and that included the pro forma contribution from an EBITDA perspective of over $1 billion from Symantec, as well as some debt paydown by the end of the year. So that largely is intact, frankly. I think you would also know we came off of the cyclical downturn in semis last year and at least through the first half. As we discussed, we're -- frankly we're flat if anything on the semi side and CA actually is up. So from an EBITDA standpoint, it would take quite a bit of a drop in the organic business, very meaningful drop actually where EBITDA would actually be down year-over-year, especially given the Symantec contribution. So I think from a leverage level standpoint and as it relates to our rating profile, we feel pretty comfortable."

We're well ahead from an operating expense standpoint. And so I think by and large, we're off to a decent start. On the revenue side relative to CA, Symantec had a bit more on the -- in the form of perpetual licenses. When we bought the business over we did take a purchase accounting haircut, which is reflected in the numbers. We also successfully sold the managed services business, we're getting set to close that with Accenture. So that's a good thing. And so what I think you'll see is as bookings continue to come online and we move into not only the second quarter, but in the second half, we will continue to progress toward the $1.8 billion run rate that we articulated last quarter."

        "Thanks for taking my question. And Hock I understand the visibility is limited, but should we assume second half can still be better than the first half because when I go back to Tom's I think cash flow remarks, if I got them right, I think, Tom, you said $5.5 billion in dividend payment and $4 billion in debt pay down, so that's $9.5 billion of cash usage, which I think is higher than the $9 billion free cash flow that you had outlined in the last call for fiscal '20. So that definitely suggests strong free cash flow generation for this year. So I am just trying to look at those data points and see what are the assumptions you have for the second half of this year, both from a sales and a free cash flow generation perspective. Thank you."

        "Good afternoon. Just want to start off with a quick housekeeping item. Just given the strong design win pipeline that's unfolding in your compute offload of cloud ASIC business, is that now annualizing greater than $500 million per year because we're just hearing that the demand pull here is strong? And then for my main question, on the uncertainties on the prior full-year outlook your infrastructure business is all mission critical, your large customers will spend here typically in good times and in bad. And just as important, I believe that your infrastructure software business is 80% to 85% ratable revenues. So fairly predictable annuity like revenues over multiple quarters, is that what is driving the confidence on the sustainability on the software business in the second half?"

It sounds like for fiscal 2Q there you're characterizing that as a somewhat normal seasonal quarter. So I'm just kind of curious if you're putting any cushion in for the fiscal 2Q guide. And are you all at all worried that your customers are perhaps not pulling orders from you, because they are concerned about your ability to supply and that we end up having some excess inventory in 90 days."

I was hoping you could provide a little more color in terms of what went into the thought process. Was it basically that long-term agreement with your largest customer that sort of pinned down your decision or were there any other changes in terms of how you think about the market long term or your competitive position long term, the profitability of that business or did it have more to do with the valuation, the prices -- the price that others were perhaps willing to pay?

I think they are essentially the same thing. But in years, certainly in the decades past that would have been quite a meaningful statement given what's been going on with COVID in the last couple of weeks. I wonder if something has changed in the way your customers manage the supply chain that would and make this maybe not as meaningful. In other words, how much optimism should we, as analysts or investors, draw from that comment as it relates to sort of beyond just the next few weeks, but medium term outlook?"
