          "content": "By the way, to answer the first question, our current outlook covers all aspects, including what you indicated with regard to export restrictions and everything else. All those are comprehended. And as regards to 5G, we see the — to be honest, we don't know if we're talking about devices, phones, that's an interesting question. It's very consumer-driven.\n\nAnd right now, to be honest about this, we don't know how fast the ramp on 5G will occur. I understand what you said about China and understand how operators might push to make that happen in terms of incentives. Where we stand at this point, we are seeing the demand more coming from our OEM, key strategic OEM customers. And what we reflect is the demand that has been shared with us from our OEM customers."

          "content": "Well, there's clearly — we have clearly been helped by the fact that we have quite a few new programs, new products. Next-generation products, I would say, have been launched. These are leadership products, as I've always indicated. So in that sense, we stand in a fairly unique position of being able to harvest or garner a lot of the share in that business.\n\nBut based on what we are seeing, we're not seeing any weakness in the cloud nor in the telcos. We are, in fact, seeing continued sustained demand for the products, for our networking products in these sectors."

          "topic": "WiFi 6 Uptake and Demand Drivers",
          "content": "OK. Well, again, that's a very interesting question on WiFi 6 because, with regard to WiFi, that's a key franchise we invest a lot of resources into. We're talking about investing considerable dollars, R&D dollars, in this space because we are needed on two areas. As you probably know, we supply WiFi, the latest leadership products, in flagship phones, particularly in our strategic North American OEM.\n\nWe provide all those WiFi/Bluetooth combo chips, which provides the latest features in those. And that's one area where we have a strong leadership position. We also have a very strong leadership position in WiFi 6, the current 802.11ax generation in access, what they call, mention, access gateways. Basically, it's almost like home infrastructure, connectivity in the homes, connectivity in the offices, enterprises and offices, and connectivity that's provided now as service providers and telcos bring signals, basically bring data, video signals into houses, into your homes.\n\nAnd in this environment of work from home, we are seeing a strong surge of demand from telcos, service providers as they expand this WiFi service as part of broadband to the homes because those terminations, whether it's cable, fiber or copper DSL very often terminates in WiFi access gateways that allows the signals to be in the home. Also, we're also seeing that many homes, many consumers are themselves upgrading connectivity in their homes by going out and buying retail routers. As we all know it, WiFi retail route is the latest generation, which we are very well featured in for the own homes, and that's creating a very strong surge of demand of what I call broadband and what a lot of it comprises WiFi 6."

          "topic": "ASIC Business and Competitive Strength",
          "content": "The ASIC business is something we've been doing for many, many years, and we've gone through various evolutions. But in many ways, we have gone from strength to strength simply because of the breadth of our portfolio of IP cores in silicon. Obviously, ASIC is still tied to silicon. We have a lot of it.\n\nWe have lots of intellectual property capabilities, and we've been doing it for a long time. And I'll be honest, you make a lot more money — it's a much more sustainable model running merchant silicon than in ASIC. It's a broader market. You create products that can be more innovative in many ways because you — we include software with many of our merchant silicon, whether it's our switch, whether it's our broadband chips, WiFi chips.\n\nWe provide SDK. We provide interface, software-driven, makes it programmable. All that gives it flexibility. ASIC is still a very core part of our business, and we do very well by it.\n\nAnd it's a business, though, we see that has certain limitations."

          "topic": "Dividend Policy and Free Cash Flow Management",
          "content": "No, Harlan. Your math is fairly spot on. I think we clearly are going to assess the dividend at the end of the year. But keep in mind, we are in a recession.\n\nWe're still dealing with COVID. We've got an election coming. And so I think we want to wait, obviously, until we get to the end of the year, talk to the Board, look at the outlook for '21 before we jump to any conclusions. But you're right.\n\nI mean our capital allocation policy is to allocate approximately half of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of the dividend. We've had that in place now for several years, and we think that's the right approach. We're going to continue to take the other 50%, manage the balance sheet as we are this year. We paid down a considerable amount of debt by the end of this year, $5 billion, which we're happy with.\n\nWe think the balance sheet is in a very good place as we exited fiscal '20. And then we're back to sort of, I think, a normal behavior in terms of looking at how to drive the total shareholder return above and beyond the dividend, allocating capital, either to M&A and/or to buybacks. And so we'll address the dividend question, as we always do, at the end of the fiscal year but look forward to executing in this quarter, posting results and then having that discussion."

          "topic": "Revenue Ramp from Symantec Integration",
          "content": "Sure. It's Tom. Things are progressing well. It's a unique deal, it's an asset purchase we took the decision to drive integration quickly. We're well ahead from an operating expense standpoint. And so I think by and large, we're off to a decent start. On the revenue side relative to CA, Symantec had a bit more on the -- in the form of perpetual licenses. When we bought the business over we did take a purchase accounting haircut, which is reflected in the numbers. We also successfully sold the managed services business, we're getting set to close that with Accenture. So that's a good thing. And so what I think you'll see is as bookings continue to come online and we move into not only the second quarter, but in the second half, we will continue to progress toward the $1.8 billion run rate that we articulated last quarter."

          "topic": "Margin Improvement and Leverage",
          "content": "Yes. So I mean I think when you take that and you look at — and we highlighted in the prepared remarks the semiconductor business turning the corner and now returning to growth, which I think is important. You layer in increasing diversification from software and the scale that affords us and, of course, the margins that it brings, especially with the synergies on the go-to-market that we're driving, I think over the horizon here, I think we see a path, frankly, of 30% to 60% EBITDA margins. I think that's the next stop.\n\nBut I think Hock's right, we have consequently, over many, many years, by driving more content increase through R&D investments, been able to drive margins up incrementally and that will contribute to the overall success of the margin increases that we see coming."

        "Thanks very much. Actually, just a quick clarification and a question. Clarification, I just wanted to make sure your outlook kind of excludes or reflects if there are any restrictions on shipment to any Chinese customers. And then, Hock, my real question is on 5G.\n\nYou gave us very good color on the near-term trends. But what have you seen in the first market for 5G, which was China? As the transition happened very quickly, the majority of phones there are now 5G. Do you see that to be the case for your exposure also in that a bigger percentage of the phones you're shipping into can be 5G so you see the content benefits faster than you might have thought before? Thank you."

        "I wanted to dive a little bit into the networking portion where you said the cloud side and the telecom side is strong. There's been some fear in the end market as a whole that we're potentially entering a digestion phase from the cloud side of that equation.\n\nAnd then very recently, one of your pseudo-competitors talked about some service provider lull in demand there as well. It doesn't seem like you're seeing that. Is the end market different in your view? Is it weakening or not? Or are you just overcoming that with company-specific new product launches and ramps?"

        "Hock, I just want to go back to your comments about some of the supply constraints you saw in the fiscal second quarter and expect to see in the fiscal third quarter. Is there any way to quantify the revenue impact? And I guess specifically why I'm asking, while the sequential growth in network, up 11%, in the fiscal second quarter is solid, at least by our math on a year-over-year basis, it's only up about kind of mid to high teens, which is kind of significantly underperforming a lot of the other cloud semi guys that have reported. And so I'm just trying to square that circle. And were the supply constraints more dominated in a certain part of the business?"

        "I wanted to go back to wireless. In the press release, you used the word expected substantial reset. So does that mean that the product delay was expected or was that expected a reference to the semi custom business that we knew was rolling off that you had told us a couple of quarters ago? I think it's going from $1.1 billion last year, like $500 million this year.\n\nAnd more generally two quarters ago, you gave some wireless growth targets for the year. I think it was down about 10% for the full year. I assume you're tracking below that now given what's going on. But can you give us some order of magnitude idea of how the wireless business is actually tracking right now versus the color that you had given us two quarters ago for what to expect this time [Phonetic]."

I guess, if you put all that in there, it looks like networking growth would actually accelerate, I mean, at double digits. So I'm just kind of curious, if you look at the three segments, service provider, data center and enterprise, just some comments.\n\nI know you have product cycles that are driving a lot of the growth but just kind of curious on your thoughts on the market embedded in that guidance."

Hock, I wanted to ask about, when I look at your software businesses, I see sometimes bookings in double digits, but the revenue growth is a lot lower than that.\n\nAnd I wanted to understand that mechanism why the revenues are always lagging your order growth rate. And then, are you done with the attrition of customers in Symantec? Or what is the expected time frame for that?"

        "Your wireless business is booming, obviously, on the 5G release with your largest customer, but maybe we can talk about a little bit longer term. There's no secret, your largest customers' largest initiative is to do their own baseband modem. And I mean that's a job unto itself.\n\nThe interface, the entire RF front end, has to usually be designed by somebody other than the baseband guys. That's the case for all baseband providers now. In fact, most baseband from MediaTek to Qualcomm are turning to the incumbents, the large RF semi companies, to do the actual architecture design itself. Since you are the strategic partner for the largest portion of that, is it fair to assume that you will be intimately involved in this? And does that change the nature of your relationship in terms of revenue growth or margins? Because this is a once in a company history event for your largest customer, if they can get it working, they're going to need all the help they can get.\n\nSo how does this affect the margin profile and, more importantly, the revenue growth over the next two, three years in wireless?"

You talked about extended lead times, you talked about wireless growing into fiscal Q1 and you also highlighted the semiconductor solutions sustaining into Q1.\n\nSo as we put all that together and obvious strength, particularly of the networking side, is it fair to say that semiconductor should grow again into January?"
