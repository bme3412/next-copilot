          "content": "OK. That's a very good question. And the investment, we -- the cadence of the investment we're doing continues in areas that we see as very strategic in various businesses. And you've seen some of that coming out as we continue to do so.\n\nFor instance, last week, we announced the introduction and ramp -- and introduction availability of the -- our 800-gig platform for switching, routing, and interconnects, and the basic size, retimers and all that, that goes hand in hand with it. So, all about launching 800-gig platform and that comes in the form of our new product, Tomahawk 4. And it's pretty interesting that we're launching it now because our previous generation, which is at 400-gig platform, Tomahawk 3, which we introduced over a year ago, is just starting to ramp. We then will have -- in terms -- into a larger market.\n\nAnd we're already launching an 800 gig. So, the speed and -- the regularity and the speed at which we are pushing this product is definitely something we intend to keep where we're coming out with a newer generation, probably -- that is probably 2x throughput capacity and the regularity of 18 months to two years on a consistent basis because that's what our hyper cloud customers want. And it makes sense because we need to scale our data centers as CPUs start to hit the limitation of the Moore's Law. Now, that's one example.\n\nAs part of that, as we indicated a year ago, we're stepping our investment in areas of silicon photonics, basically to enable interconnects at very high throughput, at very high bandwidth. And that's been going very, very well. It's a multiyear investment. And as we indicated -- from the last time we talked about it, we are now only on the second year, but we expect to have something that will make -- that will be out to the marketplace within a generation or two of our platforms in switching and routing.\n\nAnd that's on that aspect of it. In terms of further investments, we have stepped up investment, as I indicated in my report, on WiFi, on connectivity of basically 802.11ax now. And we launched that platform two years ago, and very successful. And we're already working on -- and we have invested a lot on the next-generation WiFi 7, successor to this WiFi 6.\n\nIn between, we're putting out 6-gigahertz WiFi, that's WiFi 6E, which is the spectrum bandwidth recently was approved by the FCC not long ago. And we already have our first product certified by the FCC recently. We're the first out there. So, we intend to be in the lead, for instance, in this wireless connectivity, which by the way, today, as I indicated, represents a very substantial and growing part of our business.\n\nAnd it's a testimonial to the reliable investment and success we've gotten in this area. And so, these are some of the things that we have. And most of this investments are multiyear, but you do start to see some of the bands, some of the products, some of the launches, some of the revenues starting to come in with this level of investments we are making in here."

          "topic": "Wireless Business Trajectory and Seasonality",
          "content": "Well, that's a tough question. And to begin with, we generally don't talk much about Q2, though I did give you guys some indication based on backlog we're sitting today why it's unlikely to flow. But I mean, you're right. I mean, we have this $14 billion of backlog, which continues to grow.\n\nAnd substantially, most of it -- a lot of it will be filled between Q1 and Q2, to begin with in a bigger picture. But in the way you ask in respect of wireless, you're correct also in pointing out when we do year-on-year comparisons now, it's very interesting because the Q4 fiscal '20, the quarter we just finished and reporting on, becomes the first quarterly ramp of our wireless business, and it compares to Q4 fiscal '19, which in typical cycles in the past is you see the peak quarter of revenue seasonally for our wireless business. So, you're comparing an initial ramp against a peak quarter. And that's down, as I indicated, 9% year on year.\n\nThe big ramp now for this current generation of phones in our wireless business will be our Q1, the quarter we are in now. And that compares to the Q1 of fiscal '20 now, which is post big ramp of the last generation, which is why I also indicated we're likely to see a 50 -- around a 50% year-on-year step-up in our wireless revenue. Now we go on to Q2 -- and I think people -- probably things get back to more normalcy, and as always, expect wireless to demonstrate a seasonally -- seasonality as probably the bottom quarter of an annual cycle."

          "topic": "Capital Allocation and Shareholder Returns",
          "content": "We think it's very much back to business as usual.\n\nI think obviously, 2020, we got into the crisis mode earlier in the year. I think we focused a lot on pushing out maturities. We, you know, added the balance sheet from a liquidity standpoint, which we continue to do. And, you know, the markets were very favorable and we're able to do all that.\n\nI think obviously, business also came back and performed quite well. And as Hock's talked about, we've got a decent amount of visibility in the first half, and we'll see what happens in the second half. But, you know, it seems like the year is set up for a reasonable amount of success. And so, I think with that in mind, we're comfortable with our investment-grade credit rating.\n\nWe have delevered. We paid down $3 billion of debt in Q4. We're upping the dividend, as you mentioned, and sticking to the policy of giving back about 50% of free cash flow. So that's going to leave us with some excess cash.\n\nAnd we always look at it as, you know, what are the right relative returns and what's best for shareholders. And that usually means buying back stock or doing M&A. And I think we'll certainly look at doing both. You know, we're biased toward acquisitions historically, and I think we'll continue to be so as long as we can find the right targets and generate the right returns consistent with our business model.\n\nSo, I'd really say business as usual, Ross."

So I mean I think when you take that and you look at — and we highlighted in the prepared remarks the semiconductor business turning the corner and now returning to growth, which I think is important. You layer in increasing diversification from software and the scale that affords us and, of course, the margins that it brings, especially with the synergies on the go-to-market that we're driving, I think over the horizon here, I think we see a path, frankly, of 30% to 60% EBITDA margins. I think that's the next stop.\n\nBut I think Hock's right, we have consequently, over many, many years, by driving more content increase through R&D investments, been able to drive margins up incrementally and that will contribute to the overall success of the margin increases that we see coming."

          "topic": "Dividend Policy and Free Cash Flow Management",
          "content": "No, Harlan. Your math is fairly spot on. I think we clearly are going to assess the dividend at the end of the year. But keep in mind, we are in a recession.\n\nWe're still dealing with COVID. We've got an election coming. And so I think we want to wait, obviously, until we get to the end of the year, talk to the Board, look at the outlook for '21 before we jump to any conclusions. But you're right.\n\nI mean our capital allocation policy is to allocate approximately half of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of the dividend. We've had that in place now for several years, and we think that's the right approach. We're going to continue to take the other 50%, manage the balance sheet as we are this year. We paid down a considerable amount of debt by the end of this year, $5 billion, which we're happy with.\n\nWe think the balance sheet is in a very good place as we exited fiscal '20. And then we're back to sort of, I think, a normal behavior in terms of looking at how to drive the total shareholder return above and beyond the dividend, allocating capital, either to M&A and/or to buybacks. And so we'll address the dividend question, as we always do, at the end of the fiscal year but look forward to executing in this quarter, posting results and then having that discussion."

          "content": "Sure. It's Tom. Things are progressing well. It's a unique deal, it's an asset purchase we took the decision to drive integration quickly. We're well ahead from an operating expense standpoint. And so I think by and large, we're off to a decent start. On the revenue side relative to CA, Symantec had a bit more on the -- in the form of perpetual licenses. When we bought the business over we did take a purchase accounting haircut, which is reflected in the numbers. We also successfully sold the managed services business, we're getting set to close that with Accenture. So that's a good thing. And so what I think you'll see is as bookings continue to come online and we move into not only the second quarter, but in the second half, we will continue to progress toward the $1.8 billion run rate that we articulated last quarter."

        "Thanks for taking my question, and good luck to Tom and Kirsten and Charlie in your new roles. Hock, the question is for you on supply constraints that several of your peers in semiconductors have mentioned, whether it's in substrates or wafers or foundry capacity. I'm curious where does Broadcom stand on this. Is supply a factor in your reported results or your Q1 outlook or something that you think can constrain the growth in fiscal '21? Just what steps are you taking to make sure it doesn't constrain growth and also, on the other side, make sure customers are not double ordering because of all these supply issues? Thank you."

        "Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution, and congratulations to all on the executive appointments. Hock, you know, we're still at the very start of the 400-gig networking upgrade cycle with your hyperscale customers. It seems like telco service providers are also starting to adopt the white box switch and routing model, which is good for your Tomahawk and Jericho chipsets.\n\nAnd then you guys are also benefiting from the optical connectivity that goes along with your switching solutions. Beyond this quarter, do you see sustainability of the networking upgrade and spending cycle through next year? And then given the wafer and substrate constraints, are your lead times in networking expanding beyond six months now?"

        "I had a question on the wireless trajectory. Last quarter, just given the change in seasonality, you had given us a little bit of color -- actually on this quarter, you said it would probably still grow sequentially.\n\nHow should we think about the seasonality into -- I guess, is it the May quarter or February just especially given there seems to have been a pushout. It looks like wireless in Q4 was -- actually came in a little lower than you had expected, and it sounds like some of that's pushing into Q1. So, can you -- I guess, given those dynamics and given that's the seasonal peak in Q1, can you give us some idea, similar to what you did last quarter, on what to expect for the wireless trajectory into fiscal Q2?"

        "Yeah. Good afternoon, Hock. Glad to see that you're sticking around. I guess I want to ask some of the questions around the management change and specifically Tom's new position.\n\nI'm just kind of curious what that might mean for the software infrastructure business longer term and whether or not there's any sort of plan to potentially actually spin that business out. And I asked the question because, clearly, when you look at the core IP you have in your silicon business around I/O, around acceleration and how important those IP blocks are, when you look at the sum of the part valuation of overall Broadcom, it just looks dirt cheap. You've doubled the operating margins in the software businesses since you acquired those companies, and you've got great franchises in silicon, and yet you're trading at a big discount. Is there a belief that perhaps the best way to get value longer term for these businesses might be a spin? And is that part of the rationale behind Tom's new position?"

Is that an organic number, or does that include M&A? And then on M&A, Tom, if you can speak to the pipeline and software and your thoughts on valuation today, that would be helpful.

        "Your wireless business is booming, obviously, on the 5G release with your largest customer, but maybe we can talk about a little bit longer term. There's no secret, your largest customers' largest initiative is to do their own baseband modem. And I mean that's a job unto itself.\n\nThe interface, the entire RF front end, has to usually be designed by somebody other than the baseband guys. That's the case for all baseband providers now. In fact, most baseband from MediaTek to Qualcomm are turning to the incumbents, the large RF semi companies, to do the actual architecture design itself. Since you are the strategic partner for the largest portion of that, is it fair to assume that you will be intimately involved in this? And does that change the nature of your relationship in terms of revenue growth or margins? Because this is a once in a company history event for your largest customer, if they can get it working, they're going to need all the help they can get.\n\nSo how does this affect the margin profile and, more importantly, the revenue growth over the next two, three years in wireless?"
