            "content": "Our prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter."

            "topic": "Operating Costs and Inflation",
            "content": "We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business, divided into externally driven costs, primarily inflation, and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage."

          {
            "topic": "Externally Driven Costs",
            "content": "The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Line haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which were already much higher than pre-COVID levels. The cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates, and the cost of fuel is approximately 1.5 times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs compared to last year."

          {
            "topic": "Productivity and Fixed Cost Leverage",
            "content": "Productivity and fixed cost leverage costs are more within our control. We faced a labor-constrained environment in the second half of 2021, and the emergence of the Omicron variant led to staffing challenges. This resulted in lower productivity, adding approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. We expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2 as productivity improves. Additionally, we have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network, leading to $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We expect these effects to persist for the next several quarters as we adjust to the current capacity."

            "topic": "Overall Incremental Costs",
            "content": "Combining externally driven and internally controllable costs, we have approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. About two-thirds of these costs are within our control. Our guidance includes an expectation of incurring approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2."

We continue to see strong demand from a diverse range of customers, including governments, not-for-profits, start-ups, and enterprises."

For full year 2022, we expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, primarily to support AWS innovation. Fulfillment and transportation capital expenditures are expected to be lower or flat compared to the prior year."
