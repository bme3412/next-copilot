            "content": "For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over-year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. The dollar's strengthening during the quarter resulted in a higher foreign exchange impact than initially guided. The worldwide stores business remained focused on customers, driving sales growth through improved in-stock rates and delivery speeds. Third-party sellers accounted for 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever."
