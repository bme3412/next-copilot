            "content": "To your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business. I think, broadly, we’ve always found that over many years, when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. So typically, the trends we see carry over well.\n\nOverall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, we are definitely -- I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions, as well as in general it all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it’s still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience in front, but we are positive about what this transition means."

            "topic": "Gemini and AI Differentiation",
            "content": "On SGE and Search, look, I think it tends to really -- we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of factual answers, linked to sources across the web and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. And we have been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries, which are more complex where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience.\n\nWe’ve already served billions of queries, and it seems to cut across categories. But we are still continuing our testing and we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we’re seeing it in our metrics, and we’ll continue evolving it through the course of this year."

            "topic": "AI-Driven Search Capabilities Future Structure",
            "content": "On your first question, look, broadly I think of it as people are looking for information. They’ve always looked for it in many, many different ways. We’ve given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google.\n\nIf you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there’s always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they’re looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible.\n\nSo I don’t see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways that people could get information, but we worked hard to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people get information. But it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn’t have done before, and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source. So that’s how I see the opportunity ahead."

            "content": "At a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology. We’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case.\n\nAnd so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none. And we will continue driving efficiencies from there."

            "content": "Overall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again. Those remain the driver. They’re the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI."

            "content": "So I think what you’re referring to was my CapEx comment. I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see.\n\nWe do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. And talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments.\n\nAnd then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 -- or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one.\n\nAnd then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we’re really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that’s Infrastructure, Data Analytics, it’s Security. And so I can’t comment on others, but we feel good about where we’re sitting here and looking forward. And we’ll let you do the forecasting.\n\nGCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they’re doing there. And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace."

            "topic": "Cost Structure Re-engineering and Expense Management",
            "content": "And in terms of our opex trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense in opex from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter.\n\nSo a little bit of complexity there. But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various workstreams that we’ve talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various workstreams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we’re doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we’re doing around optimizing how and where we work. You have seen some of those announcements this quarter, beyond the workforce reduction, things that we’re doing in, for example, office services. And we’re executing against each of these various workstreams. So our view is that there’s more to do. And as we tried to be clear, we’re in execution mode. You’ll see some of the benefit in ’23. You’ll see more of it in ’24. And we’re going to continue building against it beyond."

            "content": "So in Network, really it’s a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. I would contrast that – last quarter, we talked about both pullback in YouTube and Network. And we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ads spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in Network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well.\n\nAnd then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in opening comments as well. I think it’s a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we’re intensely focused on all elements of the cost base and the long-term path to attractive profitability.\n\nAt the same time, I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is – we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers.\n\nSo as I’ve said in the past, you shouldn’t extrapolate from quarter to quarter. But we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here."

The war in Ukraine was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. The impact from ATT remained relatively constant, continuing to be a headwind. We are focusing on continuing to invest in YouTube and delivering value to our ecosystem, including users and creators."

            "content": "I have covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time. And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: Bidding, targeting, creative, as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences.\n\nWe are seeing in core Search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding, as a very significant one on the targeting side, the broad match on creatives, responsive search ads, automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we’re seeing in those areas.\n\nI think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that, one, you asked about hurdles and gating factors, the AI Essentials play a huge role in this, trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we were very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we’re expecting here."

            "topic": "Sales Force Intensity and AI Impact",
            "content": "On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations, or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have two large different teams. One is our LCS, Large Customer Solutions team, that’s really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions team, which is the channel where really every customer starts, from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs.\n\nThe GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it’s also our fastest-growing channel and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side.\n\nBut I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there’s always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We’re not restructuring because AI is taking away roles, that’s important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale. And that’s why we’re doing some of those adjustments.\n\nSo I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here."

            "content": "We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities.\n\nIt basically means that every YouTube viewer who is interested in the NFL can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on a YouTube TV subscription, and as a standalone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans.\n\nOn YouTube TV, we are building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we will be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience, like comments, chats, polls, and so on.\n\nOn the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we are really excited to see what they’ll do across long form, Shorts, live streams and more."

            "topic": "YouTube Shorts Monetization and Growth",
            "content": "On the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly: 50 billion-plus daily views up from 30 billion last spring. We are still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us; as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience which we’re paying a lot of attention to.\n\nAds on Shorts are now available -- it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. You have Video Action, App, Discovery, Performance Max campaigns -- and via product feeds, Shorts are also shoppable. And again, we’re the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens, and really with multiple ways to make a living.\n\nAnd Sundar shared just yesterday we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. And ultimately our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators, and that’s really what our focus is at the moment."

            "content": "So retail is an important vertical and driver for us. And I called out the year-over-year increase in Retail in Search and Other.\n\nI also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we’ve established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it’s online, offline, both. We’re helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop.\n\nMaybe a little more, some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products.\n\nI have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example.\n\nAnd then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube, app deep linking, and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here. Making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points.\n\nOverall, we are giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI, and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payments side for their customers. And this will continue to be our focus here."

            "topic": "AI Essentials and Advertiser Support",
            "content": "We are really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity and I covered this earlier.\n\nFor example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow. In PMax, I mentioned the automatically created assets, the Product Studio and so on. When I talk to customers, they are very excited about AI and understandably have some questions.\n\nOne of the top questions is, for example: What’s the next best step I should take? This is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It’s a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI. It has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI products. It really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success.\n\nSo those are just some of the examples. If you extrapolate those going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of the upside, apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned."
