            "content": "Brian, thanks. I’ll take the first part. I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side.\n\nObviously, on the consumer side, I’m pleased, as I said in my comments earlier, in terms of how, for a product like Search, which is used at scale over many decades, how we’ve been able to introduce it in a way that it’s additive and enhances the overall experience and is positively contributing there.\n\nI think across our consumer products, we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously, monetization is something we will have to earn on top of it.\n\nOn the enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where there are definitely a lot of models. I think roughly the models are all kind of converging towards a sort of base capabilities but I think where the next wave is working is to build solutions on top of it.\n\nAnd I think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, et cetera, where we are seeing some of those use cases seeing traction. But I still think there’s hard work there to completely unlock those."

And we have been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries, which are more complex where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience.\n\nWe’ve already served billions of queries, and it seems to cut across categories. But we are still continuing our testing and we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we’re seeing it in our metrics, and we’ll continue evolving it through the course of this year."

            "content": "At a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology. We’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case.\n\nAnd so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none. And we will continue driving efficiencies from there."

            "content": "Overall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again. Those remain the driver. They’re the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI."

            "topic": "Durably Re-engineering OpEx",
            "content": "And on the second question, first, thank you for your comments.\n\nLook, the reason we consistently use the term, the phrase, that we’re focused on durably re-engineering our cost base is because these are deep workstreams. They’re not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we’ve talked about are around product and process prioritization, around organizational efficiency and structure.\n\nBoth of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. Across all of those, as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them.\n\nSo in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter, with the combination of the Devices and Services product area, with the Platforms and Ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April.\n\nAnd what we discussed last quarter and what we’re seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations helps with product execution, and what we’re really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving.\n\nAnd then more broadly, all of the workstreams that we’ve talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the workstreams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there.\n\nWe’re also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We’re continuing to build on what we’ve done with our centralized procurement organization. We’re continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. And so, again, this is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase “durably re-engineering our cost base.”"

            "content": "So in Network, really it’s a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. I would contrast that – last quarter, we talked about both pullback in YouTube and Network. And we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ads spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in Network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well.\n\nAnd then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in opening comments as well. I think it’s a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we’re intensely focused on all elements of the cost base and the long-term path to attractive profitability.\n\nAt the same time, I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is – we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers.\n\nSo as I’ve said in the past, you shouldn’t extrapolate from quarter to quarter. But we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here."

The war in Ukraine was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. The impact from ATT remained relatively constant, continuing to be a headwind. We are focusing on continuing to invest in YouTube and delivering value to our ecosystem, including users and creators."

            "topic": "Generative AI Capabilities Traction",
            "content": "I have covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time. And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: Bidding, targeting, creative, as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences.\n\nWe are seeing in core Search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding, as a very significant one on the targeting side, the broad match on creatives, responsive search ads, automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we’re seeing in those areas.\n\nI think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that, one, you asked about hurdles and gating factors, the AI Essentials play a huge role in this, trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we were very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we’re expecting here."

          {
            "topic": "Sales Force Intensity and AI Impact",
            "content": "On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations, or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have two large different teams. One is our LCS, Large Customer Solutions team, that’s really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions team, which is the channel where really every customer starts, from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs.\n\nThe GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it’s also our fastest-growing channel and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side.\n\nBut I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there’s always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We’re not restructuring because AI is taking away roles, that’s important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale. And that’s why we’re doing some of those adjustments.\n\nSo I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here."

            "topic": "NFL Partnership Objectives and Performance",
            "content": "We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities.\n\nIt basically means that every YouTube viewer who is interested in the NFL can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on a YouTube TV subscription, and as a standalone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans.\n\nOn YouTube TV, we are building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we will be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience, like comments, chats, polls, and so on.\n\nOn the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we are really excited to see what they’ll do across long form, Shorts, live streams and more."

          {
            "topic": "YouTube Shorts Monetization and Growth",
            "content": "On the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly: 50 billion-plus daily views up from 30 billion last spring. We are still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us; as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience which we’re paying a lot of attention to.\n\nAds on Shorts are now available -- it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. You have Video Action, App, Discovery, Performance Max campaigns -- and via product feeds, Shorts are also shoppable. And again, we’re the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens, and really with multiple ways to make a living.\n\nAnd Sundar shared just yesterday we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. And ultimately our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators, and that’s really what our focus is at the moment."

            "topic": "Retail Advertising Strategy",
            "content": "So retail is an important vertical and driver for us. And I called out the year-over-year increase in Retail in Search and Other.\n\nI also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we’ve established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it’s online, offline, both. We’re helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop.\n\nMaybe a little more, some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products.\n\nI have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example.\n\nAnd then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube, app deep linking, and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here. Making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points.\n\nOverall, we are giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI, and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payments side for their customers. And this will continue to be our focus here."

            "topic": "AI Essentials and Advertiser Support",
            "content": "We are really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity and I covered this earlier.\n\nFor example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow. In PMax, I mentioned the automatically created assets, the Product Studio and so on. When I talk to customers, they are very excited about AI and understandably have some questions.\n\nOne of the top questions is, for example: What’s the next best step I should take? This is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It’s a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI. It has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI products. It really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success.\n\nSo those are just some of the examples. If you extrapolate those going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of the upside, apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned."
