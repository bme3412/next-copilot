            "content": "On Search, great question. I still think we are in very early stages. A recent example which I was proud of was when the ship was stuck in the Suez Canal and then it got out. If you asked a question to Google, I think very soon after that we had the right answer. It seems obvious to do, except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go, and that’s how we think about it over the long-term."

            "content": "BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements. And that was based on the Transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing to invest that way – in the deep technology. As the web is scaling up, there’s more information than ever before. So that’s a big part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there’s a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You’ve seen our efforts around Shopping. That’s one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there so – but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp?"

We're one of the largest R&D investors in AI in the world and, obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we – over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is – we definitely – I think we are at an inflection point. And we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in You saw a version of that when we shipped BERT in Search, and it was one of our biggest quality improvements. But you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android, as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view and definitely want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp?"

            "topic": "Cloud Cost Structure and Investment",
            "content": "Thanks for the question. So in terms of Cloud and overall performance – I think, the main point I would say is, I wouldn’t extrapolate generally from quarter to quarter, given we’re still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud, given the opportunity. And so, as you said, there were a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter."

          {
            "topic": "Capital Allocation and Operational Excellence",
            "content": "And so the main takeaway is we’re continuing to invest. We’ll invest aggressively in products and go-to-market, what we’ve talked about quite consistently over time. And as much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time, at this point, we do remain focused on investing to build the organization for long-term performance."

            "topic": "Advertising Revenue Growth Drivers",
            "content": "So overall, what we indicated is that the strong results reflect, in part, lapping the impact that we saw starting late in Q1 of last year and then a pickup in a number of areas. I think the main thing we’d want to leave you with is that we are seeing, in part, an acceleration in the shift to digital. But it’s too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure. There’s some obvious examples. If you think about, for example, the bump in consumption for things like outfitting your home to work from home, obviously, that doesn’t repeat. And so our main thing is we think it’s premature at this point to really assess how durable those consumer behavior trends are."

            "content": "So in terms of your question on efficiency, I appreciate the question. I think at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing and capital allocation is, first and foremost, to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It’s about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we’re investing in what I keep referring to as operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation."

As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount. We are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space. And so we’re continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities."

            "content": "Yes. On the YouTube side, let me start with our direct response business. Growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically nonexistent on YouTube a few years ago, and it’s now a large and fast-growing business. And we’re just getting started, in my view. People already, as you know, go to YouTube to decide what they want to buy. And we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities so viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite creators directly on YouTube."

            "topic": "YouTube Advertising Effectiveness",
            "content": "Just as an example, as part of our BrandConnect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over – I think it was – 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns. And I think we’re still scratching the surface on what’s possible really with commercial intent on YouTube. And then there’s, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let’s just say, call it, linear TV don’t really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audiences they can’t find anywhere else. And remember, more 18-to-49-year-olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined. And brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV."
          },
          {
            "topic": "YouTube TV Advertising Synergies",
            "content": "Yeah, we've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps advertisers reach younger audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We launched a YouTube masthead on TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in, basically, a single moment. Many are taking advantage of it – Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time, and so on. And we also made it possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens. And one, will be called one singular lineup."

            "content": "Quickly, on the third-party cookie strategy, in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online. And people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced the Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web. And we're making great progress. We shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback. We shared recently as well our – what we call, FLOC – our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web."

And, yes, we heard from customers. They have a very strong interest in advertising and streaming environments. I mentioned how we combine it in the single lineups. So that's an interesting path going forward."

How do you think about the key investment priorities and innovation areas to continue to make Search more and more helpful for your users and your advertisers?",

          "And then maybe for Ruth, models showed great efficiency last year on the cost side and margins. Anything you’re learning or experiences during the pandemic that we can think about post-pandemic on cost efficiencies or things like that?"

So I’m wondering if you can talk about the pace of change around data science and how Google can sustain its competitive advantage in those areas.",
          "And then, Philipp, I wanted to follow up on the momentum in Search that you attribute to Google Shopping. Is it fair to say that the shift to free product listings has led to the desired increase in retail advertising across the platform, or are there other reasons beyond the pandemic that you attribute for that success?"

I think we’ve had record numbers of new business formations in the country and around the world on the unfortunate impact of COVID. But I think that’s – my guess is it’s been a huge tailwind for your business. At the same time, we’ve had this real tipover, I think, of linear TV ad budgets in the back half of the year to online channels like YouTube. So talk about these new advertisers that you’ve brought onto the Google platform, what you’ve been able to do, how confident you are in your ability to retain them, your advertiser retention strategy."

And Google and online in general presented a golden opportunity to really help them grow their business. So where do you think you are in terms of putting together an easy-to-use set of tools to help those who otherwise don't really have agency representation, so that they can reach all the different customers that they should be reaching across all the diverse services that you're offering?"
