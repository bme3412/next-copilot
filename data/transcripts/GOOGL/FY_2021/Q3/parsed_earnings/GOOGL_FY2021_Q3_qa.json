            "content": "We see so much headroom, given our bet on AI. Going to our most important product of all, Search, when you see the launch of BERT, which was a significant improvement, and we are following that up with MUM, which is another extraordinary advance. So the rate information is growing – pretty rapidly, and so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking, etc., is one of the most important ways we invest. Beyond that, all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multimodal way, be it images, audio, text, video, and then bringing it up across our products is an important approach."

We are willing to go as deep in the stack as needed, with silicon both on the cloud side with our Tensor Processing Units and on the client side with Google Tensor. We are thinking through compute, networking, building data centers, making sure they are clean and carbon-free, and investing in advanced models and algorithms. Additionally, we are looking into areas like quantum computing."

We are investing in features like Shorts and shopping capabilities to enhance user and advertiser experiences. Connected TV is the fastest-growing consumer surface, and we have over 120 million people watching YouTube on TVs monthly in the U.S. We are investing in integrating YouTube with platforms like Android TV, Google TV, and YouTube TV to enhance consumer adoption of Connected TVs."

Under Bill’s leadership, we removed financial barriers by making listings free and removing commission fees. Combining free listings with Shopping Ads led to a 50% lift in clicks for merchants using both. In 2021, we focused on removing integration barriers through partnerships with Shopify, Square, BigCommerce, GoDaddy, WooCommerce, etc., making it easier for businesses to get started with Search, Shopping, Image Search, and YouTube."

Merchants can bring their product feeds into video campaigns, and we’re expanding these features. YouTube helps advertisers reach audiences they can’t find elsewhere, with over 2 billion monthly active users and a billion-plus hours of video watched daily.

Coming back to how you started the call, when you look out over the next three to five years, what do you see as some of the big investments that Google needs to make to marry your ambitions on AI and machine learning against aligning Google’s broader product and services against the rising digitalization of the global economy. Would love to have that as a framing over the next three to five years.",
          "And then maybe -- I’m not sure if it’s directed better at Philipp or Ruth, but on a shorter-duration basis, there seemed to be an element of headwinds and tailwinds in the broader macro economy. Can you talk a little bit about the business elements of Google’s products and what elements of reopening dynamic you’re seeing on a sector basis versus potential headwinds as we move into Q4 next year from things like supply chain shortages or labor shortages or things like that."

Are they really -- or is this just really a part of the process or stepping stones to bring more companies or most companies over to full cloud adoption?",
          "And then, secondly, we’re seeing a clear blurring of the lines among eCommerce, digital payments and social platforms. So I was hoping you could share the vision for Google and YouTube and the other Google apps in this context, how those pieces fit together as a closed loop shopping platform, if that’s the right way to think about it."

Or have you been able to, you know, work out, eke out, tweak out, new efficiencies in the model itself?"

          "And then for you, Philipp, people have been asking you about Search. But if you look at Search from a two-year stack, the growth is as high as it’s been in years. And I wonder if you can disaggregate for us the growth between maybe new Search customers coming on the platform versus increased spending on an existing per-customer basis? Anything to help us on kind of what drove it on a client-by-client basis on Search."

          "Sundar, I think in the past we’ve talked about the intersection of hardware and software for Google. And, you know, you touched on the Pixel 6 as well as the other examples in your prepared remarks. But as you look at all the different directions you’re going with Fitbit, Nest, and all the other devices, how has your thinking evolved over the years? And what do you envision a hardware and software, you know, integrated Google meaning to the consumer over the longer term?",
          "And I guess, Philipp, if you look at some of the emerging and developing markets today, you know, some of the companies there around the world have had to play multiple roles in helping to solve for transactional friction by rolling out payments, logistics and other solutions that we probably take for granted here in the States. So do you think Google should or could play a more expansive role in India and some of the other emerging markets to help accelerate the growth of eCommerce versus the role that, you know, you play in the U.S. and the West."

So you’re obviously doing really well there, and as large as it is and as high as the engagement is compared to just about any other app that we see across the broader Internet, the revenue at just around $30 billion this year pales in comparison to, you know, core Facebook or Instagram. So do you think that, you know, this is, obviously, a huge opportunity for YouTube, especially with Connected TV? Is there something that you guys need to change about your approach with either direct sales or kind of decoupling Search from YouTube and some of the other products that Google has under the same roof, or do you kind of think continuing along the same path is the right strategy for YouTube specifically? Any color on that would be helpful."
