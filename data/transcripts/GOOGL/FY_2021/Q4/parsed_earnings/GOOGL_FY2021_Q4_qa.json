I know you’re catching up on hiring from the last several quarters, but can you just help us understand a little bit more on where these investments are going in tech and how to think about the cost structure in ’22."

          "First, following up on Doug’s question, Susan’s been writing a fair bit on YouTube and the way it’s exposed to the creator economy and what you’re trying to build for the medium to long term. Can you talk about elements of the creator economy and how it sort of fits into your products both on the advertising side and the commerce side over the medium to long term?",
          "And then, Ruth, maybe just one follow-up on the expense side. Was there anything of a one-time nature in Q4? Because just looking at some of the corporate expense or some of the elements of the core margin, just trying to make sure if there were any one-timers that needed to be called out, because I think you talked about legal and charitable donations as well, just so we can model that right."

          "First one for Philipp. You’ve made so much progress over the last 12 to 24 months about improving the retail and eCommerce Search product for advertisers. As you look across the other verticals of Search, where are you most excited or see the most opportunity for innovation to really drive more value for advertisers in non-retail verticals as we go into 2022?",
          "And the second question, either Philipp or Sundar, you both talked about the – commerce – shopping opportunity on YouTube. Can you sort of talk to us a little bit about what aspects are already built out versus what areas of innovation are hurdles you still have to clear to really realize that Commerce opportunity on YouTube?"

          "First, on Search, very strong growth. Maybe you can help us understand where you are in kind of the AI cycle of improvements there, if there’s still a lot of room to go there. You have highlighted in several earnings reports.",
          "And second, is there any fundamental reason why Search could be higher growth today than it was pre-pandemic?",
          "And then for Ruth, Cloud had impressive growth. I’m assuming the infrastructure layer is highest in the sector. And it grew 500 million+ quarter-over-quarter, but margins did come down. And so just kind of understanding what drove that, and then what it’s going to take to really show good leverage there."

          "I just want to follow-up on Justin’s question about Search growing faster than pre-pandemic. I think, Philipp, you talked about a couple of areas within Search, and Retail was at the front of the list. I think you mentioned a few other categories. Travel was always a big category. Do you feel like Travel has come back full or is Travel still sort of underperforming for macro reasons versus where it was pre-COVID?",
          "And then, Ruth, just on the share repurchases, I think that was a record level in the quarter. How should we think about these share repurchases going forward? To what extent is it opportunistic versus, I don’t know, systematic or systemic way you think about returning cash to shareholders as every year your free cash flow rises?"

          "Sundar, you talked earlier about the JioPhone Next and the launch next week in India. I wonder if you can talk about the longer-term opportunity for Alphabet in India, you know, from opening up that product. And any type of time frame when you think you will see maybe the benefits of what you’re doing on the low price phone there.",
          "And then for Philipp, it just seems longer term as mobile targeting becomes more difficult due to all these privacy changes that there has to be a mix shift in budgets. I wonder how do you think the value proposition of Search will change going forward? And what can you do, even more than you’ve done before, to take advantage of what looks like real challenges in the ability to target and measure when it comes to mobile advertising?"

          "I just had a high-level question on YouTube. So you’re obviously doing really well there, and as large as it is and as high as the engagement is compared to just about any other app that we see across the broader Internet, the revenue at just around $30 billion this year pales in comparison to, you know, core Facebook or Instagram. So do you think that, you know, this is, obviously, a huge opportunity for YouTube, especially with Connected TV? Is there something that you guys need to change about your approach with either direct sales or kind of decoupling Search from YouTube and some of the other products that Google has under the same roof, or do you kind of think continuing along the same path is the right strategy for YouTube specifically? Any color on that would be helpful."

Are they really -- or is this just really a part of the process or stepping stones to bring more companies or most companies over to full cloud adoption?",
          "And then, secondly, we’re seeing a clear blurring of the lines among eCommerce, digital payments and social platforms. So I was hoping you could share the vision for Google and YouTube and the other Google apps in this context, how those pieces fit together as a closed loop shopping platform, if that’s the right way to think about it."

          "Zooming out a little bit on the big picture, Sundar, I think it was almost four years ago when Google released a blog post about the Next Billion Users and how developing products for India and other emerging markets will hopefully, you know, inform what you should be doing everywhere else. So I think you have previously talked about Tez being a pretty notable example there. So can you talk about whether we should continue to be looking overseas to think about what direction you might take across your various products and services?"
