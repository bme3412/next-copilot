            "content": "On Search, great question. I still think we are in very early stages. A recent example which I was proud of was when the ship was stuck in the Suez Canal and then it got out. If you asked a question to Google, I think very soon after that we had the right answer. It seems obvious to do, except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go, and that’s how we think about it over the long-term."

            "content": "BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements. And that was based on the Transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing to invest that way – in the deep technology. As the web is scaling up, there’s more information than ever before. So that’s a big part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there’s a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You’ve seen our efforts around Shopping. That’s one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there so – but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp?"

We're one of the largest R&D investors in AI in the world and, obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we – over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is – we definitely – I think we are at an inflection point. And we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in You saw a version of that when we shipped BERT in Search, and it was one of our biggest quality improvements. But you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android, as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view and definitely want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp?"

            "topic": "Cloud Cost Structure and Investment",
            "content": "Thanks for the question. So in terms of Cloud and overall performance – I think, the main point I would say is, I wouldn’t extrapolate generally from quarter to quarter, given we’re still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud, given the opportunity. And so, as you said, there were a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter."

          {
            "topic": "Capital Allocation and Operational Excellence",
            "content": "And so the main takeaway is we’re continuing to invest. We’ll invest aggressively in products and go-to-market, what we’ve talked about quite consistently over time. And as much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time, at this point, we do remain focused on investing to build the organization for long-term performance."

            "topic": "Advertising Revenue Growth Drivers",
            "content": "So overall, what we indicated is that the strong results reflect, in part, lapping the impact that we saw starting late in Q1 of last year and then a pickup in a number of areas. I think the main thing we’d want to leave you with is that we are seeing, in part, an acceleration in the shift to digital. But it’s too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure. There’s some obvious examples. If you think about, for example, the bump in consumption for things like outfitting your home to work from home, obviously, that doesn’t repeat. And so our main thing is we think it’s premature at this point to really assess how durable those consumer behavior trends are."

            "content": "So in terms of your question on efficiency, I appreciate the question. I think at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing and capital allocation is, first and foremost, to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It’s about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we’re investing in what I keep referring to as operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation."

As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount. We are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space. And so we’re continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities."

Both Philipp and I talked about that. Particularly what we saw was AdMob and Ad Manager and particular strength in App Campaigns. And all of this just underscores what each of us commented on, that the results do reflect what was broad-based strength across our partners’ properties in the first quarter."

            "content": "And to support long-term growth, and very much to your question, it’s true across both Google Services and Google Cloud we will continue to increase the pace of investment. And that’s true in headcount, it’s true with compute, sales and marketing, really across the board. And you also heard that in some of my comments about CapEx. We’re continuing to pick up the pace of investment in office facilities. Both fit-outs and ground-up construction had been slowed as a result of COVID, and we’re pleased that the pace has picked up. And that really relates to our comments about continuing to build out across the U.S., around the globe, in line with continuing to invest in headcount growth."

            "content": "Yes. On the YouTube side, let me start with our direct response business. Growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically nonexistent on YouTube a few years ago, and it’s now a large and fast-growing business. And we’re just getting started, in my view. People already, as you know, go to YouTube to decide what they want to buy. And we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities so viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite creators directly on YouTube."

            "content": "Just as an example, as part of our BrandConnect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over – I think it was – 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns. And I think we’re still scratching the surface on what’s possible really with commercial intent on YouTube. And then there’s, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let’s just say, call it, linear TV don’t really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audiences they can’t find anywhere else. And remember, more 18-to-49-year-olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined. And brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV."
          },
          {
            "topic": "YouTube TV Advertising Synergies",
            "content": "Yeah, we've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 120 million people watch YouTube on TVs every month. And that’s up from, like, 100 million last year. We’re number one in reach and watch time among ad-supported streaming services. So we’re very, very happy with the development that we’re seeing here."

            "topic": "Shopping Monetization Strategy",
            "content": "So on YouTube, look, if you look at the engagement across the platform, we definitely see a lot of headroom for ecommerce. Over the past year, you’ve seen us really focus on accelerating, a shift to – in terms of onboarding merchants across – across Google. So we have definitely invested both in terms of bringing merchants on board, removing barriers there, providing better integrations by partnering with players, platform providers, across the industry. And now we are investing in our consumer experiences, be it on Google Search or on YouTube. And so you will see us roll out features over time."

            "content": "Quickly, on the third-party cookie strategy, in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online. And people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced the Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web. And we're making great progress. We shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback. We shared recently as well our – what we call, FLOC – our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web."

            "content": "So on YouTube TV, we’re really trying to bring the – well, Connected TV is – let me phrase it from the Connected TV part. It is really the fastest-growing consumer surface that we have, and that growth started before the pandemic and has, frankly, solidified since. And in the U.S., we have over 120 million people watch YouTube on TVs every month. And that’s up from, like, 100 million last year. We’re number one in reach and watch time among ad-supported streaming services. So we’re very, very happy with the development that we’re seeing here."

          "And then, Ruth, just on cost – kind of in the back half and going forward, as you think about bringing some of these costs back, just curious if you can comment more around some of the puts and takes as you think about the overall cost structure pre-COVID versus post-COVID."

And how do you think about the sustainability here, specifically in Search and the product pipeline from here?",

          "And then for Philipp, on the momentum in YouTube and capturing the shift in viewership and advertising away from linear TV, how do the different Google services fit together in that? Not just core YouTube, but Android TV, Google TV, YouTube TV. Is this something that’s been increasingly connected or linked in the back-end and as well as in the front-end for consumers?"
