            "topic": "Search Evolution and Discover Feed",
            "content": "On Search, you're right. Today, particularly with mobile and with ambient computing, that is, you having access to computing across other form factors, it is important that you have relevant information at your fingertips. So I do think about it as a holistic user journey. And obviously, in Search, we'll continue to evolve. Discover has been very good in terms of Discover and YouTube. Both play a role in making sure people are getting relevant information. And I think for us, it's important holistically we're meeting users' information needs, and out of which the monetization opportunity also works as well. So this is why be it Discover or be it how we pick up on YouTube, all of that matters for us."

            "topic": "Hardware Strategy and Assistant Integration",
            "content": "On hardware, I'm excited about the -- we are doing some deeper investments in hardware, which are -- some of it takes two to three years to come together. And so I'm excited at the terrific roadmap ahead. I think we have definitely shown with Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, a clear value proposition. And we'll build on that. Our portfolio, we are thoughtfully thinking about what are the important form factors which matter. And we do think about it with the view of where Search and Assistant will be important as well. So in many ways, hardware is there to strategically benefit both how we guide the Android ecosystem and how we make sure information is right there at users' fingertips. So those are both strategic views we take into it as well. But I'm excited about the roadmap ahead. And next year, you will see us lean more into -- some of our deeper investments will come into play there."

            "topic": "AI Strategy Evolution",
            "content": "An area which -- first of all, across the board, the progress is steep. So I'm very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for me, it's important that we are state of the art as a company and we're leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and R&D teams are working, both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant improvements with BERT in Search. But BERT took us a few years to get there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by it. An area where I think we are still under tapped vis-Ã -vis potential is definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. And I think it's related to Heather's question too. I think companies are thinking about migrating workloads and so on. But the longer-run opportunity of actually using AI to truly have business solutions for you, for whatever industry you are in, that's the aspect there is a lot of potential and we are still very early there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots internally and bringing it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas. But I see it as a bigger opportunity in the future."

            "topic": "eCommerce Competition and Strategy",
            "content": "I think as a company our strength comes from diverse categories in which we serve users, right? And it's not just products, it's services. It's wide areas including areas like travel. So it's diversified. And -- but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength but there are areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what is reflected in what you see. On eCommerce, you're right, there are eCommerce providers that are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential categories like groceries and stuff which are built in, which we don't directly play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long-term focused effort on shopping with the new leadership team is to precisely make sure as a platform we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to be an important place by which people come and participate in those journeys. So long-run, I see a growth opportunity with related to what we are investing in, in there as well, not just through Search -- but Search and the Shopping investments we are making -- but in YouTube, and also helping retailers on the Cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of interest to work -- to partner with Google. And so we see that as a big opportunity as well."

            "topic": "Cost Structure and Margin Sustainability",
            "content": "Thanks for that, Doug. So, as I said, as a result of COVID, we did make tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. And that started late in the first quarter. And, in part, that's what you see here, plus the impact from the improvements in revenue performance. And we do remain focused on optimizing efficiency where we can. We've said that on many prior calls. But as both Sundar and I noted today, we are committed to making the right investments to support long term profitable growth. And I think what's exciting in this environment, there appears to be an acceleration in digital transformation that underscores the importance of the products and services that we provide and the longer term opportunities. So we will continue to invest to best position ourselves for the long term opportunity. An obvious example is Cloud. We do intend to maintain a high level of investment, given the opportunity we see. That includes the ongoing increases in our go-to-market organization, our engineering organization, as well as the investments to support the necessary capex. So, hopefully, that gives you a bit more color there."

            "topic": "Ads Revenue Growth and Seasonality",
            "content": "So in terms of the first question, as we've often said, we have a very diverse business globally; and that's across sectors, customer size, geographies. And with respect to sectors, we saw broad-based improvement across virtually all. It basically mirrors what you see in the broader economy, and we don't break out more than that. But it was quite broad-based."

            "topic": "YouTube Ads Revenue and Subscriptions",
            "content": "So overall, we're pleased at the degree to which advertisers really have reactivated their budgets in the third quarter. They're reacting in part to, I think, evidence that consumers are showing strong demand across nearly all verticals. It's everything from home and garden to computer to work from home. And so very helpful there. And then YouTube's strong watchtime growth enables advertisers to reach audience that they can't reach on TV, as we've often talked about. So they're increasingly looking to us to help them reach people who are going to YouTube to learn new topics and engage with fresh, entertaining content, great, great unique content. So it's been an opportunity. We're pleased to have seen the performance in the third quarter here."

          {
            "topic": "Share Repurchase Authorization",
            "content": "We remain focused on investing for long-term growth. The primary use of capital really is to support that growth. The second use is to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already been talking about. Given our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. We view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital."

            "topic": "Sites TAC Rate Trends",
            "content": "So in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things. We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content costs are included in other cost of sales. And so that's the most important thing to point to. The other, as we've previously discussed, is TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there."

Can you take a step back and maybe give us your sense of how Search is going to evolve from the product it is today, where there's a lot of input by the user, to sort of the push dynamic with the Discover feed and Discovery Ads and things that could drive both engagement and monetization across your platform?",
          "It seems that you're taking a little bit of a different tactic with your hardware strategy this year. There was a little bit less of it, and it was more on the mid-to-lower end of the price range of hardware. How does hardware and broadly tying the Assistant into the hardware strategy fit broadly into your view for where Search is going for the medium-to-long-term?"
