          "content": "On Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the potential there. Team has been executing very well. Overall, users come to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for. But we see an opportunity to invest and make the experience better. Sometimes the journeys may fail because they don't find what they are looking for, so we want to make sure it's comprehensive. Next, when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to transact. And so working on that end-to-end experience has been a big focus. And obviously making sure for merchants, really making sure we are open to business for merchants and we are giving value to them -- has been the focus. Early indications are that users are responding positively, both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways it's a return to our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for merchants to connect with users. And so I'm excited by it and you'll continue to see us focus in this area."

          "content": "The second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well in terms of engagement and watchtime. And so we see a long-term opportunity there. We've had strength on direct response as well through this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously investing not just in YouTube, main product YouTube -- TV as well. And so, areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming. And so bringing the bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on that."

          "topic": "Post-Crisis Strategic Priorities and AI Investments",
          "content": "In terms of overall priorities, I would say we've always taken a long-term view in thinking through the arc of where things are going. And our deep focus on AI is an example of that. And we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term. And so, if anything, through moments like that, the strong foundation we've built, allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term areas. So AI is a good example of it. The shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we're going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment. And so the thesis still remains. So we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale -- is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that. Beyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging. So, for example, eCommerce is an area. And, as I mentioned, we responded through this with the changes we announced on our Shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there. And with new leaders in place, we're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there. And so we are looking at shifts, be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G Suite, and adapting and investing in those areas as well. So that's how we're approaching it."

          "topic": "YouTube Monetization and Direct Response Growth",
          "content": "I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right, it's a platform working at scale. I think Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So looking across, I think there is more room -- significantly more room over the mid- to long-term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it."

          "topic": "YouTube TV and Brand Advertising Synergies",
          "content": "YouTube TV -- it's a good question. I spoke earlier about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more opportunities there. We are obviously still in the early stages of building out the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and making sure it's working well. In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market too. So overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I think the synergies with YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited at the traction the product is getting, but still too early."

          "topic": "Cost Structure and Expense Optimization",
          "content": "Thanks for those, Doug. In terms of cost structure, as we talked about last quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you are seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on investing for the long-term. So sort of breaking that down, in cost of revenues, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of Other Cost of Revenues that are not directly correlated with revenue growth, as I noted in opening comments. And we are very focused on the user experience in the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to make sure that we are supporting our products so they remain reliable in all environments. And then in opex, much of our operating expense is generally less variable and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of a couple of the items, although we do continue to expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiring aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near term steps to enhance efficiency but still investing for the long-term. So we're trying to make sure that we're getting those trade-offs -- those trade-offs right. And as I noted, we do expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 20% year-on-year rate last year and that’s even adjusting for two items that put upward pressure on headcount growth. First, we're moving certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operations center that is actually opex neutral but does increase reported spend and headcount and, second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we’re trying to navigate it appropriately."

          "topic": "Ads Revenue Growth and Seasonality",
          "content": "In terms of Ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our Ads business, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it's premature for me to comment on the trend. In terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as we said, for Search and Other Revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter. But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter, while Brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March. So by the end of March, total YouTube Ads Revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single-digits."

          "topic": "Share Repurchase Authorization",
          "content": "We remain focused on investing for long-term growth. The primary use of capital really is to support that growth. The second use is to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already been talking about. Given our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. We view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital."

          "topic": "Sites TAC Rate Trends",
          "content": "So in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things. We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content costs are included in other cost of sales. And so that's the most important thing to point to. The other, as we've previously discussed, is TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there."
