            "content": "Thanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity to, across the breadth of what we do at Google, to improve our experiences. Obviously in Search, we’ve been using AI for a while. It’s what has really helped lead Search and Search quality for the past few years, using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs, and I think -- I think the main way -- and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We’re going to -- our North Star is getting it right for users, so we’ll iterate and innovate as we have always done.\n\nThe main area maybe I am excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to Search. They follow on. They’re engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it’s a real opportunity.\n\nObviously, if it’s YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, et cetera. I think you can expect changes.\n\nWorkspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it’s an area where I think we’ll see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help.\n\nAnd obviously on Cloud, this has been an important moment as pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from startups to large companies, they’re engaging with us. So I view it as a point of inflection there as well."

            "content": "Thanks, Doug. Obviously we have launched Bard as a complementary product to Search. We’ll be bringing LLM experiences more natively into Search as well.\n\nI do think, first of all, we’ll be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test, iterate and innovate. So I think we’ll approach it that way.\n\nI think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I’m excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries maybe in which there was no right answer and they are more creative, et cetera. So I think those are opportunities.\n\nBut even in our existing query categories, where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better -- guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It’s early days, but I think there’s a lot of innovation to come.\n\nOn the cost side, we’ve always -- cost of compute has always been a consideration for us and, if anything, I think it’s something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, it’s a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet.\n\nAnd so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it, because I think we have built world-class capabilities. And taking that and then driving down costs sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world.\n\nSo I think we’ll take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here, but I’m comfortable with how we’ll approach it."

            "topic": "AI Impact on Capex and Margins",
            "content": "So starting on your question about AI and capex. As I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max and Smart Bidding and Cloud. As Sundar said, it is more compute-intensive, but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers.\n\nThat being said, we’re very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that’s across all elements: data centers, servers and our supply chain. So we’re continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital.\n\nAnd as I indicated in opening comments, when we look at capex for 2023, we do expect it’s going to be generally in line with 2022 with an important mix shift. We’re increasing our investments in technical infrastructure. And that’s not just for AI, that’s to support investments across Alphabet; in particular, in Cloud as well. And at the same time, we are meaningfully decreasing our capex for office facilities."

And that’s because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute. They’re in process now and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. But we’re continuing to work through them."

            "content": "We’ve seen pullbacks in spend by some advertisers, which was the biggest factor in the quarter-on-quarter change. The war in Ukraine was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. The impact from ATT remained relatively constant, continuing to be a headwind. We are focusing on continuing to invest in YouTube and delivering value to our ecosystem, including users and creators."

            "content": "So in Network, really it’s a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. I would contrast that – last quarter, we talked about both pullback in YouTube and Network. And we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ads spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in Network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well.\n\nAnd then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in opening comments as well. I think it’s a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we’re intensely focused on all elements of the cost base and the long-term path to attractive profitability.\n\nAt the same time, I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is – we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers.\n\nSo as I’ve said in the past, you shouldn’t extrapolate from quarter to quarter. But we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here."

            "topic": "Cost Structure Rationalization",
            "content": "And in terms of our opex trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense in opex from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter.\n\nSo a little bit of complexity there. But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various workstreams that we’ve talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various workstreams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we’re doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we’re doing around optimizing how and where we work. You have seen some of those announcements this quarter, beyond the workforce reduction, things that we’re doing in, for example, office services. And we’re executing against each of these various workstreams. So our view is that there’s more to do. And as we tried to be clear, we’re in execution mode. You’ll see some of the benefit in ’23. You’ll see more of it in ’24. And we’re going to continue building against it beyond."

            "content": "Yeah, thank you so much for the question. We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities.\n\nIt basically means that every YouTube viewer who is interested in the NFL can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on a YouTube TV subscription, and as a standalone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans.\n\nOn YouTube TV, we are building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we will be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience, like comments, chats, polls, and so on.\n\nOn the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we are really excited to see what they’ll do across long form, Shorts, live streams and more."

            "content": "On the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly: 50 billion-plus daily views up from 30 billion last spring. We are still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us; as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience which we’re paying a lot of attention to.\n\nAds on Shorts are now available -- it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. You have Video Action, App, Discovery, Performance Max campaigns -- and via product feeds, Shorts are also shoppable. And again, we’re the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens, and really with multiple ways to make a living.\n\nAnd Sundar shared just yesterday we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. And ultimately our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators, and that’s really what we’re focused on at the moment."

And I called out the year-over-year increase in Retail in Search and Other.\n\nI also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we’ve established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it’s online, offline, both. We’re helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop.\n\nMaybe a little more, some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products.\n\nI have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example.\n\nAnd then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube, app deep linking, and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here. Making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points.\n\nOverall, we are giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI, and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payments side for their customers. And this will continue to be our focus here."
