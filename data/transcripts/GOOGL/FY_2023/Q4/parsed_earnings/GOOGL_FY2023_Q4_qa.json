            "content": "To your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business. It starts with Search. I’ve been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we’re making sure the product works well and we are generating value for our ecosystem and that Ads transitions well.\n\nI think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we’ve always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side.\n\nAnd I do think over time there will be newer paths, just like we’ve done on YouTube. I think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well.\n\nObviously, all of the AI investments we’re doing applies across Cloud, too, and I’m pretty optimistic about what’s ahead there as well."

            "content": "On Gemini, obviously, it’s an effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I’m very excited at the progress there and as we’re working through getting the model ready.\n\nTo me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we’ll be launching all throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient with tool and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well.\n\nWe are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we’ll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and Cloud customers through Vertex.\n\nSo I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other. And we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising."

            "topic": "AI-Driven Search Capabilities Future Structure",
            "content": "On your first question, look, broadly I think of it as people are looking for information. They’ve always looked for it in many, many different ways. We’ve given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google.\n\nIf you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there’s always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they’re looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible.\n\nSo I don’t see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways that people could get information, but we worked hard to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people get information. But it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn’t have done before, and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source. So that’s how I see the opportunity ahead."

            "topic": "Search Generative Experience Monetization and ROI",
            "content": "Throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search and as we have evolved Search, I think we’ve always had a strong, grounded approach in terms of how we evolve Ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users.\n\nThe fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information; and in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so that’s what drives this virtuous cycle.\n\nAnd I don’t think -- the underpinnings are the fact that users want relevant commercial information. They want choice in what they look at. Even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, et cetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And, as I said, we’ll be iterating and testing as we go. And I feel comfortable we’ll be able to drive innovation here like we’ve always done."

            "content": "At a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology. We’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case.\n\nAnd so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none. And we will continue driving efficiencies from there."

            "content": "Overall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again. Those remain the driver. They’re the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI."

            "topic": "CapEx Expectations and Technical Infrastructure Investment",
            "content": "So I think what you’re referring to was my CapEx comment. I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see.\n\nWe do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. And talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments.\n\nAnd then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 -- or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one.\n\nAnd then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we’re really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that’s Infrastructure, Data Analytics, it’s Security. And so I can’t comment on others, but we feel good about where we’re sitting here and looking forward. And we’ll let you do the forecasting.\n\nGCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they’re doing there. And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace."

          {
            "topic": "Cost Structure Re-engineering and Expense Management",
            "content": "And in terms of our opex trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense in opex from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter.\n\nSo a little bit of complexity there. But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various workstreams that we’ve talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various workstreams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we’re doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we’re doing around optimizing how and where we work. You have seen some of those announcements this quarter, beyond the workforce reduction, things that we’re doing in, for example, office services. And we’re executing against each of these various workstreams. So our view is that there’s more to do. And as we tried to be clear, we’re in execution mode. You’ll see some of the benefit in ’23. You’ll see more of it in ’24. And we’re going to continue building against it beyond."

            "topic": "Cloud Business Momentum and Profitability",
            "content": "So in Network, really it’s a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. I would contrast that – last quarter, we talked about both pullback in YouTube and Network. And we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ads spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in Network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well.\n\nAnd then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in opening comments as well. I think it’s a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we’re intensely focused on all elements of the cost base and the long-term path to attractive profitability.\n\nAt the same time, I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is – we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers.\n\nSo as I’ve said in the past, you shouldn’t extrapolate from quarter to quarter. But we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here."

We’ve increased the authorization for share repurchases to $70 billion and are pleased to execute against it. Share repurchases remain a valuable tool in our overall set of investments."

The war in Ukraine was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. The impact from ATT remained relatively constant, continuing to be a headwind. We are focusing on continuing to invest in YouTube and delivering value to our ecosystem, including users and creators."

            "content": "We are very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really a maximum performance across all inventory from one really AI-powered campaign, and it’s probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our Ads products. It’s delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve on average over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action.\n\nSince rolling it out about two years ago, we’ve continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works. We have a lot of things, like account-level negative keywords, other details here. We launched new lifecycle goals -- customer lifecycle goals, we called them. A revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives. I think that’s one to watch.\n\nWe will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we’re seeing. So we are very, very encouraged by the progress here."

            "content": "We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities.\n\nIt basically means that every YouTube viewer who is interested in the NFL can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on a YouTube TV subscription, and as a standalone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans.\n\nOn YouTube TV, we are building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we will be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience, like comments, chats, polls, and so on.\n\nOn the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we are really excited to see what they’ll do across long form, Shorts, live streams and more."

            "topic": "YouTube Shorts Monetization and Growth",
            "content": "On the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly: 50 billion-plus daily views up from 30 billion last spring. We are still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us; as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience which we’re paying a lot of attention to.\n\nAds on Shorts are now available -- it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. You have Video Action, App, Discovery, Performance Max campaigns -- and via product feeds, Shorts are also shoppable. And again, we’re the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens, and really with multiple ways to make a living.\n\nAnd Sundar shared just yesterday we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. And ultimately our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators, and that’s really what our focus is at the moment."

            "content": "So retail is an important vertical and driver for us. And I called out the year-over-year increase in Retail in Search and Other.\n\nI also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we’ve established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it’s online, offline, both. We’re helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop.\n\nMaybe a little more, some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products.\n\nI have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example.\n\nAnd then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube, app deep linking, and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here. Making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points.\n\nOverall, we are giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI, and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payments side for their customers. And this will continue to be our focus here."

            "topic": "AI Essentials and Advertiser Support",
            "content": "We are really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity and I covered this earlier.\n\nFor example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow. In PMax, I mentioned the automatically created assets, the Product Studio and so on. When I talk to customers, they are very excited about AI and understandably have some questions.\n\nOne of the top questions is, for example: What’s the next best step I should take? This is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It’s a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI. It has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI products. It really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success.\n\nSo those are just some of the examples. If you extrapolate those going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of the upside, apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned."
