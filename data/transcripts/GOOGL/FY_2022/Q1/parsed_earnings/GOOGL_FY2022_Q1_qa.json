            "content": "AI and ML are broader, deeper investments that we are driving and using across our product portfolio. The recent launch of Tensor and Pixel 6 is a great example. We are willing to go as deep in the stack as needed, with silicon both on the cloud side with our Tensor Processing Units and on the client side with Google Tensor. We are thinking through compute, networking, building data centers, making sure they are clean and carbon-free, and investing in advanced models and algorithms. Additionally, we are looking into areas like quantum computing."

            "topic": "AI and Machine Learning Investments",
            "content": "We see so much headroom, given our bet on AI. Going to our most important product of all, Search, when you see the launch of BERT, which was a significant improvement, and we are following that up with MUM, which is another extraordinary advance. So the rate information is growing – pretty rapidly, and so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking, etc., is one of the most important ways we invest. Beyond that, all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multimodal way, be it images, audio, text, video, and then bringing it up across our products is an important approach."

We are also exploring integrations with NFTs to enhance the creator experience. Our focus is on enabling creators to monetize their content effectively while providing engaging experiences for viewers. Additionally, we are investing in shopping capabilities on YouTube to integrate commerce seamlessly."

We have launched the YouTube Shorts Fund, which is available in over 100 countries, and over 40% of creators who received payments were not in the YouTube Partner Program. We are also testing ads on Shorts with products like App Install and Video Action campaigns and are encouraged by the early results. Our team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time."

            "content": "In terms of the Ad business, we were very pleased with the year-on-year Search revenue growth in the first quarter, up 24%. This reflected the strength we’ve seen in retail. However, this growth benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020, which means we won’t have that tailwind moving forward. Additionally, our suspension of commercial activities in Russia and the impact of foreign exchange rates are factors we’re considering as we move into Q2 2022."

We view share repurchases as incrementally valuable and continue to allocate capital towards it. Regarding our cost structure, while operating margins remain strong at around 30%, this is primarily due to strong revenue growth. We continue to invest in headcount, technical infrastructure, and other strategic areas to support long-term growth."

We suspended most of our commercial activities in Russia, which accounted for about 1% of our 2021 revenues, primarily from advertising. Additionally, there was a pull-back in advertiser spend on YouTube in Europe due to the conflict."
