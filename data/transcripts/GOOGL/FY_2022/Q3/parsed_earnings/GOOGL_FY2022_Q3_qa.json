And every time -- talent is the most precious resource, so we are constantly working to make sure everyone we have brought in is working on the most important things as a company, and particularly so. And that’s a lot of what sharpening our focus has been about.\n\nWe are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there, and based on that, the right resourcing and making course corrections. And this will be an ongoing thing. It is something we will continue doing going into ’23 as well."

            "content": "Yes, and to the second part of the question, as we discussed before, we’ve always focused on building a great user and creator experience first, followed by increasing monetization over time.\n\nWe continued to experience a slight headwind to revenues as Shorts viewership grew as a percentage of total YouTube watch time. And as I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging, and we are focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time.\n\nAnd more specifically, consumers are increasingly consuming short-form video. We are seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. And as I said earlier, Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion+ logged-in users every month."

            "content": "Look, I think it’s always important that we try and understand our user segments and their needs so that we can make sure the products are helpful and working for them.\n\nAnd we also conduct thousands of studies a year to understand how user needs are evolving. And as part of it, there are some studies which obviously show people, particularly younger users, in certain categories -- maybe fashion inspiration, as an example -- look for more visual ways to engage. And so these are all learnings we are constantly taking in, and we use it to improve Search.\n\nAnd if you saw Search On, we had many, many explorations and product directions which move in that direction. So I think it’s a healthy way of iterating and innovating to build the best products and services for our users.\n\nSo, in summary, we are integrating AI deeply into our Search products to enhance user experience, making it more visual and aligned with the evolving needs of younger demographics."

It’s across a wide range of industries and geographies, and it really comes back to the team’s focus on helping them solve unique business issues and innovate in new areas as they digitally transform.\n\nI think more to your question, and we talked about this a bit last quarter – in some cases certain customers are taking longer to decide, and some have committed to deals with shorter terms or smaller deal sizes, which we attribute to more challenging macro environments. Some are impacted due to reasons that are specific to their business.\n\nBut overall, as you can see from the results here again, we’re pleased with the momentum in Cloud and do continue to be excited about the long-term opportunities. So that’s why I made the comment that we do continue to invest meaningfully in this business. We’re still focused, very much so, on the path to profitability and free cash flow strength here. But we are continuing to invest in the business."

But if I look at, sort of the Excel sheet, I think you have added about 51,000 new people to the company since the start of last year. Can you give us some examples of internal KPIs or quantifiable analysis you’re running just to ensure you’re generating ROI for investors from all your hiring as you sort of run through these analyses?"
