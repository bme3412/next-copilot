It’s a chance to digest and make sure we are working on the right things as a company with – taking a long-term view, making sure we are continuing to invest in deep technology and computer science and doing differentiated work; and gives a chance to assess everything we’re doing with a critical lens; and reallocate resources to our most critical priorities. So it’s a constraint optimization problem. I think it gives us a chance, given a few years of strong growth, to double down and focus, and we’re going to be very disciplined in terms of how we will approach it. But our focus on the long-term areas, be it AI, be it Cloud and other critical areas will continue."

            "content": "In terms of the Ad business, I would say, as I did in opening comments, we were very pleased with the year-on-year Search revenue growth in the first quarter, up 24%. And it really reflected the strength that we’ve seen in retail, as Philipp and I commented on. I would say – as you’re asking how are we looking forward, I would say, the revenue growth rates that we delivered in 2021 in Search and across our advertising businesses more generally, as I said in opening comments, did benefit from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. So I think one key point is that we’re not going to have that tailwind for the rest of this year. And as I noted, one of the key areas to focus is Q2 of 2020. That was where we had the largest impact from COVID. So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we’re going to face a tough comp, as I said. I would say, in addition, the second-quarter results are going to continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. And then I noted the impact of foreign exchange. So as we’re looking at it generally, we feel good about what we’re doing in the business, a couple of key points that I called out there."

For some it’s inventory issues. So we will leave the forecasting to you, and tried to give you sort of the components as we went through Q2 here."

Can you just talk to – what are you seeing in your business specifically on the advertising side or the Cloud side that is sort of saying – now is when we really do need to make sure we’re optimizing?
