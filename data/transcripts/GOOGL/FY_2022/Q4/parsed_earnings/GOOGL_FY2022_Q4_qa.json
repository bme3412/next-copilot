And every time -- talent is the most precious resource, so we are constantly working to make sure everyone we have brought in is working on the most important things as a company, and particularly so. And that’s a lot of what sharpening our focus has been about.\n\nWe are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there, and based on that, the right resourcing and making course corrections. And this will be an ongoing thing. It is something we will continue doing going into ’23 as well."

            "content": "Yes, and to the second part of the question, as we discussed before, we’ve always focused on building a great user and creator experience first, followed by increasing monetization over time.\n\nWe continued to experience a slight headwind to revenues as Shorts viewership grew as a percentage of total YouTube watch time. And as I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging, and we are focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time.\n\nAnd more specifically, consumers are increasingly consuming short-form video. We are seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. And as I said earlier, Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion+ logged-in users every month."

            "content": "Look, I think it’s always important that we try and understand our user segments and their needs so that we can make sure the products are helpful and working for them.\n\nAnd we also conduct thousands of studies a year to understand how user needs are evolving. And as part of it, there are some studies which obviously show people, particularly younger users, in certain categories -- maybe fashion inspiration, as an example -- look for more visual ways to engage. And so these are all learnings we are constantly taking in, and we use it to improve Search.\n\nAnd if you saw Search On, we had many, many explorations and product directions which move in that direction. So I think it’s a healthy way of iterating and innovating to build the best products and services for our users.\n\nSo, in summary, we are integrating AI deeply into our Search products to enhance user experience, making it more visual and aligned with the evolving needs of younger demographics."

            "topic": "AI Impact on Capex and Margins",
            "content": "So starting on your question about AI and capex. As I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max and Smart Bidding and Cloud. As Sundar said, it is more compute-intensive, but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers.\n\nThat being said, we’re very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that’s across all elements: data centers, servers and our supply chain. So we’re continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital.\n\nAnd as I indicated in opening comments, when we look at capex for 2023, we do expect it’s going to be generally in line with 2022 with an important mix shift. We’re increasing our investments in technical infrastructure. And that’s not just for AI, that’s to support investments across Alphabet; in particular, in Cloud as well. And at the same time, we are meaningfully decreasing our capex for office facilities."

            "content": "And then with respect to the overall efficiency opportunities, very keen focus on the three areas that I noted, and one of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure.\n\nWe noted that we want to be focused and that we are focused on durable improvements to our expense base. And that’s because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute. They’re in process now and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. But we’re continuing to work through them."
