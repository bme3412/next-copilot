          "content": "In terms of the key investments, you know, we still continue -- you know, we have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques, et cetera, across the board. So it's an important area we are focused on. And, you know, making sure -- digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful, you know, is the main theme by which we are evaluating everything we do."

          "content": "As we are making the experience better for consumers, including on products like Discover, so just getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it. I think they all, you know, tend to have a commercial aspect, the right intent when users are interested in it. So while we see them go hand in hand, taking a long-term view I think will resonate on the monetization side as well."

          "topic": "Go-to-Market and Partnership Strategies",
          "content": "Definitely, go-to-market, Thomas has been heavily focused on it, you know, mainly with the realization that we are very competitive when we are there in the mix and so focusing on how we can scale up and really build a customer-facing organization. So we are investing heavily, be it in sales, service, partner, and operational teams. We did launch our new partner program, Partner Advantage. The SAP relationship has been super important to us, and so we have really focused on that, helping many customers. McKesson, Carrefour, Home Depot, Cardinal Health are some examples of that. And a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench, you know, several new senior executive hires. In addition to our new global head of sales, we recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support. So I think you're going to see that focus of being -- serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what we do. And so that's going to be a focus for us."

          "topic": "AI and Machine Learning Advancements",
          "content": "On machine learning, I don't think we are at very early days. I'm excited that over the last three years, taking AI first approach, we really incorporated machine learning, core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users and that's true for advertising as well. I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to understand what they're looking for and us taking care of more and more work and we're doing it across the board, but there is a lot of headroom here."

          "content": "On your important question about kid safety, you know, as part of our content responsibility work, it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids. And, you know, it's a product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there and make sure it's safe for kids and gives parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well. So all the work we are doing, be it the work we are doing to just remove bad content, raise up authoritative content, higher-quality content, and reducing the spread of borderline content, all applies everywhere. And, you know, we are really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- you know, ensuring creators who produce content which is great for children, rewarding them, et cetera, are also important goals for us."

          "topic": "Revenue Performance and FX Headwinds",
          "content": "On a reported GAAP basis, revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year. And as you know well, we don't report Sites revenues on a fixed FX basis, but the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Sites revenue. Beyond that, I tried to draw out that the year-on-year growth rate in part reflects our strong 2018. And then more to your question, as we indicated last quarter, the other item is that timing of product changes in ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers. Over the long-term, we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing. And that was sort of the overarching color I was trying to give you."

          "topic": "Desktop Search Performance",
          "content": "In terms of Desktop, it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks, such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And as we've talked about on prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of Desktop for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. So I lead with the items that are really driving the growth, but that was a bit more color on Desktop for you."

          "topic": "Pay-Per-Click Growth and Cost Per Click (CPC) Deceleration",
          "content": "As we've discussed on prior calls, the biggest driver affecting both CPCs and click trends is YouTube engagement ads, with YouTube clicks representing the vast majority of total clicks. And so while YouTube clicks continued to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year, reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience."

        {
          "topic": "Headcount Growth and Spending",
          "content": "We do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, Search and ML. And so Cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Infrastructure Investments",
          "content": "Relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rate for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there is no change in our expectation for the year on that point, either the first quarter last year, obviously, included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York. But overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure, given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth. Technical infrastructure is the biggest driver of CapEx growth, but we do also continue to invest in office facilities."

        {
          "topic": "Sites TAC Rate Trends",
          "content": "So in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things. We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content costs are included in other cost of sales. And so that's the most important thing to point to. The other, as we've previously discussed, is TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there."
        },
        {
          "topic": "YouTube Revenue Growth and Content Responsibility",
          "content": "So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there, given your question, you know, I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and, again, strong here in the second quarter. To clarify, you know, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter regarding Sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. Just to be really clear, the revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth were unrelated to actions on policy enforcement."

          "topic": "Capital Return and Share Repurchase Program",
          "content": "Well, I would answer them in reverse order. You know, I tried to comment on that last quarter, and reiterated again this quarter, you know, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum of the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that, as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business, and we've talked about that, we introduce product changes only after extensive testing. And that means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. And so, you know, we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring or delivering for users and advertisers. And as we're looking out -- you know, we've talked in the past, we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no one change drives results. And as we discussed last quarter, you know, there can be timing variability. And our view is, let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver. So, you know, it's -- there's really not much more to add there."

        {
          "topic": "Share Repurchase Authorization",
          "content": "The main point is, we remain focused on investing for long-term growth. And the primary use of capital really is to support that growth. And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already been talking about. And given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. And I think the main point is, we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital."

Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you are trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strengths within Google? And then the second part of the question would be, as you lower friction for consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization side about how those products might resonate on the monetization piece?"
