          "topic": "Revenue Performance and Headwinds",
          "content": "On a reported GAAP basis, revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year. And as you know well, we don't report Sites revenues on a fixed FX basis, but the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Sites revenue. Beyond that, I tried to draw out that the year-on-year growth rate in part reflects our strong 2018. And then more to your question, as we indicated last quarter, the other item is that timing of product changes in ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers. Over the long-term, we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing. And that was sort of the overarching color I was trying to give you."

          "topic": "Desktop Search Performance",
          "content": "In terms of Desktop, it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks, such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And as we've talked about on prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of Desktop for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. So I lead with the items that are really driving the growth, but that was a bit more color on Desktop for you."

          "topic": "Pay-Per-Click Growth and Cost Per Click (CPC) Deceleration",
          "content": "As we've discussed on prior calls, the biggest driver affecting both CPCs and click trends is YouTube engagement ads, with YouTube clicks representing the vast majority of total clicks. And so while YouTube clicks continued to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year, reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience."

          "topic": "Headcount Growth and Spending",
          "content": "We do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, Search and ML. And so Cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Infrastructure Investments",
          "content": "Relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rate for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there is no change in our expectation for the year on that point, either the first quarter last year, obviously, included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York. But overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure, given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth. Technical infrastructure is the biggest driver of CapEx growth, but we do also continue to invest in office facilities."

          "content": "Overall, I think you saw the momentum coming out of Next, and I would say at a high level, the key differentiators, which we are focused on and which we hear from customers too, the five key things: our security and reliability, being really open about hybrid multi-cloud, customers don't want to be locked into any one cloud provider. We want to be a platform for Open Source and so we're really working well there and enabling options, AI/ML as a capability. And finally, as customers think about digital transformations, we bring all of Google's advances to bear to help them through the journey."

          "content": "I don't think we are at very early days. I'm excited that over the last three years, taking AI first approach, we really incorporated machine learning, core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users and that's true for advertising as well. I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to understand what they're looking for and us taking care of more and more work and we're doing it across the board, but there is a lot of headroom here."

          "topic": "YouTube Content Responsibility and Recommendations",
          "content": "I talked about in the area of content responsibility, we are definitely focused on making sure we are constantly improving how we're handling both in terms of reducing the content that shouldn't be there on the platform. And then more importantly, making sure when we recommend content that we are recommending high quality content as well as reducing harmful content or low quality content being recommended."

          "content": "We are still in our early days, but our commitment is very strong. We really see this incredibly important to drive the future of computing forward and to make sure our services are presented to users in the way that we intended them to be. Phones, definitely across as an industry, I think we are working through a phase where there is definite year-on-year headwinds, but I do think especially the ecosystem is constantly pushing it forward, I continue to be excited about the innovations, be it 5G coming or the early look into foldable phones, which Android plays a big part in driving. So I do think there is a lot more to come. And we are focused on it."

        "Maybe a couple of parts on the revenue performance of the quarter. Ruth, you had called out potential volatility on the Q4 earnings call. I wanted to understand a little bit about what you were calling out in Q4 and how that might have manifested itself in Q1 on the product side of the equation, so we could just better understand how much of it was isolated to Q1 or it might be a headwind as we move through the year? And as you look at the individual performance of the ads divisions inside, Sites, Desktop, mobile search, YouTube, it seems like you were still calling out strength in mobile search and YouTube. So could it be Desktop Search, where we actually saw some weakness in the quarter? Thanks so much for any granularity and color on that."

        "On the spending side, want to understand a little more just how you're thinking about spending relative to three months ago. I know you talked about both CapEx moderating and then also headcount moderating three months ago. Just curious, at least if headcount is still in that camp per your thinking, just given that it seems like there is a pretty big ramp expected under the new Cloud CEO?"
