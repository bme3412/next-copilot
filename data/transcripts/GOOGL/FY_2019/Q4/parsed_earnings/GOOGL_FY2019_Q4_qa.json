          "topic": "Ambient Computing Investments",
          "content": "We are very excited by the vision of ambient computing and evolving that. I think it's a continuity in the sense that, over time, computing should be more intuitive to users and computing should adapt to users, not the other way around. The foundations of all this is all the work we have done with our computing platforms to date and the successful consumer services and the developer platforms we have built. And I think that's the -- most of the investments there. The phones will continue to be at the center of ambient computing for the future. So that's another important piece where we are already invested in. I think as we expand beyond, and that's what the Made by Google family is focused on, products in your home, with our Nest family of products and wearables, which we do with Wear OS and so on. So supporting that ecosystem, so whether you are at home or on the go or at work, and making sure it works. Our investments in AI across the company I think will end up playing a key role, AI and Assistant. I think they will be at the center of making sure we can anticipate what users want and serve them better."

          "topic": "Neural Network Techniques and Advertising Impact",
          "content": "Anytime we can better make sense of queries, we can serve users better, our search quality goes up and people engage more. So it's part of a long run set of things we've been working on. But this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the Search experience and search quality. And remember it will help us in a certain set of queries. There are many queries which are already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better. And so I would just characterize this as a big improvement which improves search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more. Of course, a lot of times we take the same techniques, and sometimes it makes sense on the ads side and the underlying machine learning techniques. And we'll deploy there as well."

          "topic": "Cloud Go-to-Market and Partnership Strategies",
          "content": "Overall, I know we gave some visibility into our Cloud business, and we'll continue to do that periodically. And the momentum has been great. Obviously, ever since Thomas has come in, he has continued to invest across the board. We have definitely focused a lot on scaling up our sales partner and operational teams, and it's playing out well in this business. It's important for you to be in as many deal situations as possible and get those wins, which accrues over time. And so we are definitely seeing the momentum. Analytics is a huge area of strength for us, and it's an area which Thomas has a lot of expertise in as well. And BigQuery is such a strong product, so it's a natural area we are seeing strength. And my sense is, as we get -- if I look at the TAM -- the percentage of TAM for which we were eligible compared to two years ago to last year to now, that number is shifting aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or be it completing some of the certifications we need. And so I think there are several strong forward-looking indicators, and look forward to sharing more at the right time."

          "topic": "YouTube Content Responsibility and Kid Safety",
          "content": "On your important question about kid safety, you know, as part of our content responsibility work, it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids. And, you know, it's a product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there and make sure it's safe for kids and gives parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well. So all the work we are doing, be it the work we are doing to just remove bad content, raise up authoritative content, higher-quality content, and reducing the spread of borderline content, all applies everywhere. And, you know, we are really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- you know, ensuring creators who produce content which is great for children, rewarding them, et cetera, are also important goals for us."

          "topic": "Quantum Computing Advancements",
          "content": "We're incredibly proud of the work that the team did and excited about the advancement in the whole industry. I think, in general, we've relied on advances in computing to be able to do what we do. And when we look ahead, we definitely see being able to drive the pace of change fastest is an important need for us as well as, I think, a source of competitive advantage. As Moore's Law effects have diminished, I think, we are looking at a variety of approaches to make sure we can continue doing what we need to. And in that, this is an important tool in the arsenal. While quantum will take many years to really start making a difference, we want to be at the cutting edge of driving it. I do think over time for sure, Cloud itself, we do see a lot of interest from Cloud customers, particularly in cutting-edge verticals, about quantum computing. And so that's an area where I think we will participate in as a business. And more importantly, applying it across other verticals we are in, be it health, as an example, I think will be where we will deliver value in the long run."

          "topic": "Machine Learning Applications in Ads",
          "content": "Machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads, too. Generally using machine learning to simplify things for our advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the Ads side. So, for example, processing complex data sets and giving back sophisticated, real-time insights really helps make a difference. Also on the front end, for marketers, helping them find the right creative for every moment, helping them manage bidding in real-time, and -- so every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use and, you know, driving productivity for them."

          "topic": "YouTube Subscriptions and Premium Offerings",
          "content": "Subscriptions is an area we are definitely excited about. We are pleased with the adoption so far across both YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. They're now available in 71 countries, up from five markets at the start of 2018. So we are definitely scaling that up, and we are seeing great traction. YouTube TV is also doing well. I think we just announced that PBS is coming to YouTube TV in July. Last month, we announced YouTube TV is now launching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So there is definite -- the user satisfaction on the product is very high, and so we are focused on continuing our expansion, building out a great service and building awareness for the service. So, overall, I think engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube is a focus for us. And the efforts, while early, are definitely showing strong traction."

          "topic": "YouTube Monetization and Direct Response",
          "content": "I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right, it's a platform working at scale. I think Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So looking across, I think there is more room -- significantly more room over the mid- to long-term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it."

          "content": "What's notable here is that every year at GML, we announce new changes to products and features. Most Ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result, the new products that were announced at GML typically are adopted over time. We don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years."

          "topic": "Revenue Growth and Product Changes",
          "content": "Starting first with the strength in Sites revenue, the strength we talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we discussed previously. In part it's the benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. We introduce product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. You know, we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring or delivering for users and advertisers. We've introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no one change drives results. As we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability."

          "topic": "YouTube Revenue Growth and Policy Enforcement",
          "content": "In terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there, given your question, I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and, again, strong here in the third quarter. To clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter regarding Sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. Just to be really clear, the revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth were unrelated to actions on policy enforcement."

          "topic": "Share Repurchase Authorization",
          "content": "We remain focused on investing for long-term growth. The primary use of capital really is to support that growth. The second use is to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already been talking about. Given our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. We view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Sites TAC Rate Trends",
          "content": "So in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things. We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content costs are included in other cost of sales. And so that's the most important thing to point to. The other, as we've previously discussed, is TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there."

          "topic": "Capital Return and Share Repurchase Program",
          "content": "And then on the capital return, I guess, you know, the main point is, we went back to the -- you know, we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've talked with you about before. The primary thing is, we remain focused on investing for long-term growth. And the primary use of capital really is to support that growth. And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already been talking about. And given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. And I think the main point is, we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital."

You're making it easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads. Just talk about the pace at which that -- the monetization of that or just the ad opportunities will be offered to small businesses."
