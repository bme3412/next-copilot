As we look at the annual guidance, we really do see strength across all of our businesses. So the -- the -- it's led by our larger businesses. So significant growth. We expect significant growth in server, growth in PCs, as well as growth in the semi-customer console business. But we also see growth in our graphics business across consumer and data center graphics as we ramp the full product lines there as we go through 2021. So overall, I think we're seeing the strength of the new product portfolio, as well as a positive demand environment."

We normally see the first half weaker than the second half just given the consumer bent. What we see this year is a little bit of a different shape. The shape is, from a market standpoint, we see PCs and gaming better than seasonal. There's some pent-up demand coming into the first half of the year, and -- and that's that's -- baked into the guidance. But we're also seeing a strong data center environment. So we see server up sequentially in -- in Q1, and that's on the strength of both our current products or our growing products as well as the Milan ramp. So a little bit different shape than normal, but I think we see strong demand across our PC, gaming, and data center segments."

We do see a significant growth into 2021. I think there are a number of drivers. First of all, I think we're seeing the cloud business strengthen for us. So going into the first half of the year, and as I said, that's both on the current generation Rome, as well as the next generation Milan. The reception to Milan is very strong. So we're -- we're pleased with the performance. We started shipments in Q4. That's continuing into Q1. You'll see -- we -- we expect to see sort of more customers, sort of new customers adopt Milan than perhaps some that had been on our previous generation. You'll also see a very strong enterprise portfolio. So I think we have a very strong time to market platforms with the key OEMs. And that's part of our launch plan later this quarter. So overall, I think we are optimistic about the data center in 2021. I think there's a lot of need across cloud and enterprise, and we think Milan is very well-positioned."

So we saw strength -- a little bit of strength in the console business, some strength in servers as well, and some strength in PCs. And PCs, in the fourth quarter, tend to be a bit more weighted to the consumer side of the business. So those were some of the puts and takes. But from an overall sort of margin expectation standpoint, I think we were right where we expected to be. And then going into 2021, if you're talking about the first quarter guide, I think my -- my commentary was that we see PCs and consoles a bit better than seasonal. So consoles would normally be let's call it down double digits, and that's not the case in this particular quarter. We have server up. And so, again, these are just a few puts and takes. But we do see the sequential increase into Q1 and then for the full year as we see the mix of business."

As we go into 2021, again, we see significant growth. I would say it's one of the -- the key growth drivers for the company and we'll give you updates as we go along the way in -- in 2021 in -- in terms of how -- how it's growing as -- as a relative size of -- of the business."

So we do see sort of ex -- the expansion of let's call it our competitiveness across the enterprise sort of workloads, as well as the broad set of cloud workloads. Our goal in life is to make sure that we're offering improvements in total cost of ownership to our customers. So as the performance goes up, we do expect some ASP lift as well. But overall, from a customer standpoint, it's so important that the -- the TCO really improve generation to generation. Particularly with Milan and some of the single-threaded performance is very, very helpful, and we expect on some of the enterprise workloads that perhaps can't use all of the course for -- that -- that we have will -- will be able to benefit significantly from Milan just given the uplift in overall performance. So we're excited to tell you more about it. Like I said, we'll be launching that later this quarter. But overall, we feel very good about the positioning of Milan."

I think the fact that the workloads are different and you want to customize some of those things, that's where I think the combination of AMD and Xilinx is very powerful because we can handle a lot of the customizations and optimizations and fast real-time response. But then for some of the really very heavy compute-intensive things, there's a lot of great technology out of AMD. And putting the two together seamlessly also with software really makes that a powerful solution.

And I'm just curious how you're thinking about the overall PC market? I think Intel talks about being first half weighted. And then obviously semi-custom, you probably didn't as much in December as you did the first three quarters of 2020. Kind of curious how you just think about first half, second half given that?"

And I -- I picked up on the prepared script, Lisa, that you mentioned accelerating growth for your data center franchise in 2021. I think that's probably off a business that doubled last year. So do I have that right that it will accelerate in percentage terms? And maybe you could break down a little bit. I saw Alibaba in the slides announced. There's a Milan launch coming that I think could push you into enterprise a little bit more than you've been in the past. Some drivers of that server growth would be really helpful. Thank you.",

So the question I kind of want to pose here is what would the gross margin look like if you didn't -- if you had yields similar to what you had about two years ago? Meaning that are the yields for TSMC and your -- and your overall foundry partners improving at the same rate as a normal environment? And then I have a follow-up after that.",

        "And for my follow-up, it's interesting that as you're launching Milan, your competitor is also launching their data center server. So both kind of a near term and a '21 question. On the near term, there has been some discussion of cloud digestion. I know you're -- you're talking about your business actually growing sequentially so I was hoping you could address what demand environment you are seeing in the very near term from your cloud and -- and enterprise and HPC customers. But looking out to 2021, both you and your competitor will actually be on very -- almost the same manufacturing node. So how do you think that will play a role in your customer decision making of your customers. Because I think a lot of times that discussion kind of becomes one dimensional on who is at which manufacturing node? So talk to us about even if you are on the same node as your competitor, what's your ability, and -- and confidence, and visibility to take market share in this over CPU business? Thank you."

At the same time, like gross margins sort of barely came in line with guidance. I mean they actually missed by a few kind of tens of basis points. I guess I'm just a little surprised. Is that all console mix and was consoles like that much better than expected relative to servers that you wouldn't see gross margin upside in the quarter? And I guess the same comments on the guide, a little bit of upside, but the same time we've got consoles down, we've got everything else growing, and yet we've only got a little bit of upside in gross margins. I guess if you could help me square that or square that with what you're seeing, that'd be helpful, please.",

We're actually starting to see some impacts on their ASPs and their margins.

Can you remind us where the focus is today in terms of -- in terms of your spending profile and how do you see that translating into future growth in over the next couple of years?

Sounds like you're optimistic about what the client GPU business is going to do in 2021. Can you just walk us through some of the differences, some of the opportunities, and or challenges of taking share in the GPU market versus where you've already succeeded so much in -- in, well, continue to on the CPU side of things?",
        "And then as my follow-up, one for either you or Devinder on the gross margin, you gave the shorter term answer for the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but I want to ask one about 2021 as a whole. It's good to see that it's rising again up to that 47% target. I just want to walk through the puts and takes on that. And I guess the core question is if the semi-custom business is going to grow substantially as a percentage of your revenues, what's offsetting that to have the gross margin rise year over year? Is it mixed between segments? So server, for example, is going to keep up with that? Or is there something within the segments that is also improving, whether it be in semi-custom, or graphics, or some area like that?"

I would kind of argue given the -- the -- the mix in the December quarter and the fact that it was the first quarter of the console ramp that the gross margins you were able to put up were -- were -- were quite good. And I'm kind of just trying to understand how we should think about gross margins ex-console? And as we think about '21 unfold, typically in the console business, gross margins start relatively low, but there is good improvement over time. And so what's kind of the exit rate of gross margins in your 47 full-year guide? And I guess why isn't it higher? It might just be that you guys are being conservative, but it seems like you got a lot of tailwinds as the year unfolds.",

I'm just kind of curious how -- how you're trying to be part of that conversation because, clearly, given the IP portfolio you have, given the share that you're taking, I -- I would argue you're as much a national champion as anyone in semis, but it does seem like the focus is on manufacturing.
