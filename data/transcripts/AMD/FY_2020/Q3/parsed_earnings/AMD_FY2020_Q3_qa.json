          "content": "Yeah. Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So first of all, we feel -- we're really excited about today. We feel great about our base business. I think you can see that in the strength of our results in the third quarter and our full-year updated guidance. That strategy is playing out very well as we expected, with very strong products driving market momentum. Now all -- as we look forward, at our financial analyst day, we talked about 20% CAGR as the right target for our company. I think all of that stays on track. We are a high-growth business and we want to remain a high-growth business. I think Xilinx brings a lot of opportunities that are additive to that model when you look at the markets and the capabilities and just the margins and the free cash flow generation. So 20% CAGR is the right target for the combined business. I think we feel very good about the organic growth. And we feel very good about the growth initiatives that Victor has started."

          "topic": "Server Market Context and Milan Launch",
          "content": "Sure Matt. So look, the data center business, particularly on the server side, is very important to us. We performed very well here in the third quarter, as you said, double from a year-over-year standpoint, sequential double-digit growth. We see good momentum across the cloud hyperscalers as well as in the enterprise business. We have more platforms that continue to launch here in the third quarter. As we look forward from a data center environment, I would say that the overall data center environment is actually good. As we go here into the fourth quarter, we are starting to launch Milan in terms of shipments to cloud as well as some HPC customers this quarter. OEMs are preparing to launch Milan platforms in the first quarter. And I would say it's very much a customer-specific message. Some of our cloud customers are going to continue to ramp Rome in the fourth quarter. Several are also preparing for a transition from Rome to Milan. But overall, we believe that the demand environment is good. And the thing that excites us is Milan is just very strong. It's coming in as we expected. Zen 3, we previewed some of that performance on the desktop side, but we see a strong translation into TCO benefits and performance benefits for our server products. So I mean we look forward to talking about that more as we go through the quarter. But yes, so overall, I think the data center business continues to be very strategic and performs well for us."

          "topic": "Full-Year Growth and Gross Margins",
          "content": "Yeah. So we did update full-year guidance. When we look at sort of what's changed over the last 90 days, when we were here talking to you in April, we were actually expecting that there might be some COVID-19-related weakness in the second half due to macroeconomic factors or other things like that. What we see now is better visibility into the second half of the year, and so we had originally assumed that the PC market would be down in the second half. And we now expect that we will grow in the PC processors for the second half compared to the first half. We also see data center growing from the second half to the first half. And then we have our game console ramp that is a strong ramp here in the second half. So I think it's a number of factors. We do believe that the market is a little bit better than we thought 90 days ago. But we also believe that our product traction is strong, and we're seeing that come through with our customer demand. So those are the reasons for the guidance."

          "topic": "Gross Margins Impact",
          "content": "On gross margins, I think that depends a lot on mix. That depends on â€” certainly, your question was about server. Server is certainly accretive to margin. And I think in the PC business, the second half of the year tends to be a bit more consumer-focused and notebook-focused. And so that's some of the mix relation there. And then we've said that the consoles are decreed to margin. We expect that consoles will be very strong in the third quarter. And although the fourth quarter will be lower for consoles, it's still going to be a very strong second half of the year. So those are the puts and takes there, but we feel that the mix is about right for the annual guide at 45%."

          "topic": "Edge Computing and SmartNIC",
          "content": "Yeah, sure. I mean, I think there is a lot that we can leverage from a technology and architecture perspective, but I think some of the differences are, obviously primarily the workload and also there's more element for needing more real-time kind of responses, low latency. I think the fact that the workloads are different and you want to customize some of those things, that's where I think the combination of AMD and Xilinx is very powerful because we can handle a lot of the customizations and optimizations and fast real-time response. But then for some of the really very heavy compute-intensive things, there's a lot of great technology out of AMD. And putting the two together seamlessly also with software really makes that a powerful solution. And I think that's what this is about, comprehensive and powerful solutions, right, tailored to the workloads, whether that's the edge, even endpoints, and of course, in the cloud."

        "You've put together a pro forma model that combines the companies as of the end of the third quarter. But you also mentioned a 20% growth CAGR for the business. I wonder if that might apply to the two companies after you put them together post-close, and how confident you are in that growth rate, given that in recent times, maybe Xilinx growth has been a little bit slower than the core AMD business growth, but obviously there's revenue synergy potential as well. So any comments there would be helpful.",
        "You guys put up server revenue sales that more than doubled year over year. Your competitor had some pretty disappointing results from their enterprise and government segments and guided for their combined data-centric business to be down 25% year over year in the fourth quarter. You have some momentum. You're going to launch Milan. And I think you mentioned in the release some progress on the enterprise side as well. But maybe, Lisa, you could back up and give us your context of where the server market is overall right now and how it might mean for your revenue into the fourth quarter?"

How do we think about the journey for your server business from here? Does the next 10% become more easier or difficult and why?"

We've heard from Victor and his team over the past couple of years in terms of how they're thinking about their opportunity set in 5G, data center and the core businesses. How are you thinking about the three to five year CAGR for data center, comms and some of the core markets? Then I've got a follow-up.",

And more importantly, based on the design wins that you've already secured, where do you see yourselves kind of in the middle part of '21 or exiting '21?"

On the 32% sequential guide, can you give a little color by the two end markets, the C&G and the EESC side? And then when you go into the fourth quarter, you said semi-custom will be down sequentially, which is kind of typical seasonality. But the ability for you guys to still grow sequentially, what's really driving that?",
        "How do you think about organic investments? Would opex staying at, say, 29% of revenues like you're talking about for this year, be a good way to capitalize on that opportunity as opposed to going down to the 26% or 27% you mentioned at your analyst meeting? Or within that, would you keep that a little bit tighter in line with your analyst meeting and maybe even consider going inorganic and tapping into the M&A market now that you have some cash and a very attractive currency to use as well?"
