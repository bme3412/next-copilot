          "content": "Great. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So, look, we've made significant progress on the overall MI300 program. I think we're very happy with how the technical milestones look.\n\nAnd then also, we've made significant progress from a customer side. Your question as to how the revenue evolves, so the way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that's mostly HPC with some -- the start of our AI ramp. And then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range. And that will be mostly AI so with a very small piece being HPC.\n\nAnd as we go through 2024, we would expect revenue to continue to ramp quarterly, and again, it will be mostly AI. Within the AI space, we've had very good customer engagement across the board from hyperscalers to OEMs, enterprise customers, and some of the new AI start-ups that are out there. From a workload standpoint, we would expect MI300 to be on both training and inference workloads. We're very pleased with the inference performance on MI300, especially for large language model inference, given some of our memory bandwidth and memory capacity.\n\nWe think that's going to be a significant workload for us. But I think we would see a broad set of workloads as well as broad customer adoption."

          "content": "Sure. So, the way I would frame it is we're very pleased with our third-quarter performance as it relates to EPYC overall. I think the fourth-gen EPYC, so that's Genoa Plus Bergamo actually ramped very nicely. We got to a crossover in the third quarter, which is a little bit ahead of what we had previously forecasted.\n\nAnd when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud â€“ you know, cloud was strong so strong double digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so, from the standpoint of, is it the market recovery or is it share gain? I think it's some of both.\n\nFrom a market standpoint, I would say it's still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we're pleased with the progress, and the leadership of EPYC has ended up allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter."

          "topic": "AI and Traditional Compute Interplay",
          "content": "Yeah. I think it's a good point, Vivek. So, I mean, if I take a look at 2023, I think it's been a mixed environment, right? There was a good amount of, let's call it, caution in the overall server market. There was a bit of inventory digestion at some of the cloud guys and then some optimization going on with enterprise, again, somewhat mixed.\n\nI think as we go forward, we've returned to growth in the server CPU market. Within that realm, because these -- like for example, fourth-gen EPYC, somewhere between 96 and 128 cores. I mean, you just get a lot of compute for that. So, I do think there is the framework -- that unit growth may be more modest, but ASP growth, given the core count and the compute capability will contribute to overall growth.\n\nSo, from a traditional server CPU standpoint, I think we do see those trends. 2023 was a mixed environment and I think it improves as we go into 2024."

          "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think it's an important point. What we're seeing with these AI systems is they are truly complicated when you think about putting all of these components together.\n\nWe are certainly working very closely with our partners in putting together sort of the full system, CPU, GPUs, as well as the networking capability. Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So, going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems.\n\nWe believe that there are others who are more set up for that. But I think from a definition standpoint and when we're doing development, we are certainly doing development with the notion of what that full system will look like. And we'll work very closely with our partners to ensure that that's well defined so that it's easy for customers to adopt our solutions."

But right now, based on what we are seeing, we continue to see in that similar range of that 50%. So, we are very happy and pleased about the strong momentum of our Data Center business.\n\nOn the GPU side, Lisa mentioned about $400 million, around $400 million. As we go through the quarter, we have a strong engagement with the customers. So, we do see the progress continues and we see customers placing orders. So, that's why when we go through the quarter, we start to -- increasingly confident about the revenue profile in Q4 we are guiding."

I think the team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the data center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities.\n\nI think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top-line revenue growth much faster than opex growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion."

          "content": "Yeah. Matt, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes, especially in a mixed demand environment. So, let me just comment on Q3 first. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points.\n\nAs you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double digits sequentially. There are two primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin.\n\nAnd in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment. So, that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double digit again.\n\nI think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix, is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half."

You talked about '24 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion.\n\nI was hoping you could provide a little bit more color. What percentage of this is AI versus supercomputing or other applications? Within AI, maybe talk about the breadth of your customer lineup. And how should we think about which workloads you're addressing, again, within the context of AI? Is it primarily training or inference or both?"

        "Yeah, thank you for taking the question. Just to build off that last question, Jean, I think last quarter, you kind of endorsed the notion that your Data Center business would grow. I think it was in the high single-digit range. I think you started the year thinking like 10.\n\nSo, I guess the question is, do you still see that kind of growth rate setup? And how has that $400 million evolved underneath that? Has that -- was it $300 million now going to $400 million? Just how has that changed over the course of the last quarter just to level set that Data Center expectation?\n\nAnd then following up on that as well, how would you characterize the supply side of the equation? As you look at that $2 billion number, do you feel confident that you've got adequate visibility in the supply side to hit those expectations? Any update on that side?"

I assume it's fairly concentrated in Year 1, but you also did mention multiple hyperscalers. Can you just give us a sense for how concentrated that might be?\n\nAnd now that you're getting a look at volume in that space, can you talk about, are the gross margins there going to be comparable to your other Data Center businesses?"

        "Thank you. Lisa, I also wanted to ask about that $2 billion number for Data Center GPU next year. That's still a pretty small portion, obviously, of the total TAM. Where do you think that can go? Do you think when we look at this out a couple of years, do you think you can be 15%, 20% share for total Data Center GPU or do you have aspirations to be even larger than that?\n\nAnd then my follow-up is on March. I know that there's a lot of moving parts. It sounds like Data Center is up, but PC is going to be down, normal seasonal.\n\nAnd Embedded and Gaming sound down as well. So, can you just help us shape sort of how to think about March? Is it down a smidge? Is it flat? Could it be up a little bit? And maybe then how to think about like first half, back half next year, if you even want to go there. Thanks."

      "questions": [
        "Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, on the MI300, many of your hyperscaler customers have internal ASIC solutions ready or in the process of getting them ready. So, if inference is the primary workload for MI300, do you think it is exposed to replacement by internal ASICs over time? Or do you think both MI300 and ASICs can coexist, right, along with the incumbent GPU solution?\n\nAnd then a question, Lisa, on just this interplay between AI and traditional computing. It seems like especially when it relates to ASPs and units, seems like server CPU makers are kind of holding the line on price per core. But at the same time, the cloud players are extending the depreciation and replacement cycle of traditional server CPUs.\n\nSo, I'm just curious to get your take. What do you think is the interplay between units and ASP, right? If you were to take a snapshot of what you have seen in '23 and how it kind of informs you as you look at '24, that is it possible that maybe unit growth in server is not that high but you are able to make up for it on the ASP side. So, just give us some color on, one, what is happening to traditional computing deployments? And secondly, is there a difference in kind of the unit and ASP interplay on the server CPU side?"

You're guiding it down in December.\n\nI was curious if that weakness is spread. And then your competitor talked about kind of a reset getting back to pre-pandemic levels. Just kind of curious how you framed that reset. You said it'd be weak to the first half.\n\nAnd then I just wanted to ask on the PC market. I think you and Intel have seen -- you were under-shipping in the first half. Maybe you're kind of over shipping a little bit now, restocking.\n\nI'm just kind of curious of your perspective of what that normalized run rate is in terms of the size of the PC market and kind of any perspective if inventory levels are starting to move back up."

      "questions": [
        "Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to maybe ask the AI question a little bit differently, not just focused on your GPU portfolio but more broadly. I think one of the big surprises to a lot of us is how quickly the AI market changed from accelerator cards to selling full servers or full systems for your primary competitor.\n\nAnd they've done a lot of innovation not just on GPU but on CPU on their own custom interconnect, etc. So, what I'd like to hear a little bit of an update on is just how you think about your roadmap going forward across CPU, GPU, and networking and particularly the networking part as you look to continue to advance your AI portfolio. Thanks.\n\nAnd then as my second question, Jean, I wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit and just, I guess, compliment you and the team on being able to guide up for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, gross margin if we, I guess, rewound the clock back to the beginning of the year, and the Embedded segment would be down from the peak to where you're guiding the fourth quarter, maybe down by a third. I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year.\n\nObviously, Client margins got better. But maybe you could walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin, and inside of each segment, where you're making progress because I imagine some of that progress is pretty positive underneath. Thanks."

        "Hi. Lisa, I had a question on the MI300 side of things. When you go to market, obviously, there's been shortages this year of GPU accelerators, and so a second source is definitely needed. But beyond just providing that second source role, can you just walk us through some of the competitive advantages that the customer lists that you're going to talk about on the sixth is finding to be so attractive relative to your primary competitor?\n\nThen for my follow-up, I want to focus on the opex side of things. You guys have kept that pretty tight over the years. Jean, I just wondered what the puts and takes on that might be heading into 2024. I think you're exiting this year at about up kind of high single digits, maybe 10% year over year.\n\nAny sort of unique puts and takes, especially as you guys are driving for all that MI300 success as we think about opex generally in 2024?"

        "Yeah. Hi. Lisa, I had a strategic one for you and then somewhat of a tactical one. On the strategic side, as your key competitor is sort of getting their act together on the manufacturing technology and the nodes, would it not be feasible to think that their manufacturing cost could be significantly better, let's say, than that of yours? And so, if that's the case down the line one year or two years out, I'm curious what kind of value-add offerings would AMD have to provide to a customer to keep the market share that you have in the server space, data center space and then keep that growing as well?\n\nAnd then for my follow-up, a lot of folks that we talk to think that compute game is shifting completely from CPUs to GPUs. So, it was actually very encouraging to hear you talk about your core EPYC CPUs and the traction that you're seeing with the new generation of CPUs. So, I'm curious, if I was to ask you how you think the long-term growth prospects for the next, call it, two to three to four years are for your CPU business, not the GPU but the CPU business, I'm curious what the answer would be."

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to just dial in on the Q4 guidance. If you are going to grow Data Center 50% half over half and I assume Client is up sequentially, it implies Gaming and Embedded both likely down sequentially in the 20% range.\n\nI know you said double digits. But is that right? And if that is true, especially for Embedded, what does that mean going forward into next year? I know you said it's going to be weak in the first half. Does that mean -- I mean, is it stable at these levels or does it continue to decline through the first half until things stabilize? Just how do we think about that in the context of the guidance that you've given for Q4?\n\nAnd then for my follow-up, again, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So, I know that they've been extending through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else.\n\nBut as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive. Like how much do you think you can expand gross margins year over year like in '24 versus '23, given the trends that we have entering the year?"

Would that still be gross margin accretive or dilutive or net neutral to your corporate gross margin?\n\nAnd then for my follow-up, I just had, I guess, clarification. So, it sounds like most of the MI revenue you have in the hopper right now for at least the committed revenue is LCAP. Is that true? And do you have other, I guess, confirmed or hard orders for that, or maybe just spend some time telling us how you're working with the customers or what it takes for them to go from, \"Hey, we are interested,\" to, \"Here is the purchase order?\""
