          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right.\n\nIt's a very dynamic market right now in the data center. We certainly see -- let me go through some of the pieces. So, on the positive side, we certainly see that acceleration of AI demand. From our standpoint, we see it in a couple of ways.\n\nWe have a number of design wins in AI deployments as the CPU that goes with GPUs, as well as other accelerators. So, in the head nodes, we've seen that positive on the CPU side. We've also seen some strong interest in our MI250 accelerator, which is currently shipping right now. And we see very strong pull on the MI300 accelerators that are starting production in the fourth quarter.\n\nSo, those are the positive market dynamics as we go into the second half of the year. We also see some of the softer cloud spend that is happening outside of AI as some of the cloud vendors are optimizing their capex. And enterprise, I would say, is still on the weaker side. But with all that in place, we are expecting a large ramp in second half for our data center business and weighted toward the fourth quarter.\n\nAnd we are still looking at a zip code of, let's call it, 50% plus or minus second half to first half. So, it's a big ramp, but when we look at all the components, I think that the customer pull is certainly there. And it's exciting to be in this part of the industry."

          "topic": "AI Hardware and Software Integration",
          "content": "Yeah, sure, absolutely. So, if I give you just some color on how the customer engagements are going, there's very strong customer interest across the board in our AI solutions, that includes, let's call it, multiple Tier 1 hyperscalers that we're engaged with. It includes some large enterprises. And it also includes this new category of some of these AI-centric companies that are sort of very forward-looking in terms of how they're deploying and building AI solutions.\n\nSo, from that aperture, we made a lot of progress with our ROCm software stack. I'm actually -- there is a lot more to do, but I would say the progress that we've made has been significant. We're getting lots of feedback from those lead customers. We're seeing the benefits of the optimization, so working also on the higher-level model frameworks, the work that we're doing with the PyTorch Foundation, the work that we're doing with Onyx, with Triton.\n\nAnd the key is we're getting significant real-time feedback from some of these lead customers. So, we're learning at a very fast pace. In terms of the feedback on performance, a number of companies have now been able to look at MI250 across a broad range of workloads, and that's a good translation as you go to MI300, and the feedback has been quite positive. We have customers sampling either on our lab systems, they're accessing the hardware, or sampling in their labs.\n\nAnd I would say, so far, very positive. The pull is there. There is a lot of work to be done, but we feel very good about the progress of our overall AI solutions for the data center."

          "topic": "Server Share and Roadmap",
          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Harsh. Thanks for the question. Look, in the server business, I think the most important thing for our customers is that we have a strong roadmap, and it's a roadmap that they can count on.\n\nAnd we've been building that sort of working model, that roadmap, and the trust over the past four or five years. So, I don't think there is any theoretical cap on AMD share. I would say, if we look today, there are multiple customers who have us deployed in their data centers more than 50% share. And from our view, the place where we have perhaps been a bit more underrepresented is in the enterprise.\n\nAnd that's just a matter of sort of the breadth of enterprise customers and the breadth of enterprise software. So, we believe that we have leadership today, and we are very, very focused on ensuring that we continue leadership in the market. And with that, there is an opportunity to continue to gain share in the server market."

        {
          "topic": "Generative AI Spend and Market Opportunity",
          "content": "Yeah. I think, Harsh, the best way to answer that, and again, we are all sort of -- it's all on crystal ball as to what's going to happen over the next four or five years. There is no question that the demand for generative AI solutions is very high, and there is a lot of compute capacity that needs to put in. The way we size the market is, it can perhaps grow at a rate of, let's call it, 50% CAGR plus or minus over the next three or four years.\n\nSo, that would take us to $150 billion by the time we get to 2027. Now, that's all accelerators in the data centers, so that includes GPUs, that includes other ASICs and other accelerators. But I think we have an opportunity to address a large portion of that market. So, that makes it very clear priority for us.\n\nIt's our No. 1 strategic priority, and we will continue to work closely with our customers as they optimize between CPU and GPU or spend."

          "content": "Hi, Aaron. Thanks for the question. I think as Lisa just mentioned earlier, it's a very dynamic market. There are puts and takes.\n\nWe have a tremendously strong momentum with our product portfolio, but there is continued softness in enterprise market, and also call it, the optimization is still ongoing. So, overall, on balance, we think year over year, it's probably more like a high single digit. It's really strong ramp, not only in Q3, right, sequentially earnings double-digit -- strong double-digit. And the Q4, of course, we're going to see continued sequential strong ramp."

          "topic": "Operating Expenses and Investments",
          "content": "Yeah. I think, fundamentally, and what you observe is right, very disciplined from an opex standpoint, investing in the growth is important. Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an opex standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company.\n\nAnd I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in opex will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, opex flattish or even down. I mean you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top priority for us."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Expectations",
          "content": "Yeah. I think the gross margin is, for us, the primary driver as we discussed in the past, it's really mixed. And if you look at our guidance or outlook of Q3, gross margin of 51%, it's more than one percentage point improvement sequentially despite of very significant headwind from embedded business declining in Q3. So, the data center and the client business are expected to grow double-digit sequentially and provide a positive impact on the gross margins, which actually more than offset the headwind from embedded business.\n\nSo, going to Q4, again we're not guiding Q4 and it's going to depend on mix. I would say one thing is you will have similar dynamics, right? Data centers expect to grow very significantly. At the same time, we're going to have the same headwind from embedded business declining sequentially. So, overall, we do expect gross margin to improve from this level going forward."

        "Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results. I guess, Lisa, my first question is around the data center business.\n\nI think we're all, across the industry, observing a shift in workload and spending patterns like maybe we've, arguably, never seen. And your company is in a great position to participate on both sides of that on the CPU strength, and obviously in the AI space. Last quarter, you had given us some metrics around potentially being able to grow your data center business by 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half. And maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about that milestone and the drivers of growth across CPU and accelerator for the back half? Thanks."

        "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just building on Matt's comments or question, I just want to go back to the implied revenue for the data center business for the back half of the year. Jean, I think, last quarter, you had alluded to, for the full year, the expectation is still growing 10% or double digits, I should say, for the full year, the data center business, just confirming that.\n\nAnd what I'm really trying to ask is, given the guidance of flat year-over-year growth in data center in 3Q, it would seem, if my math is correct, you're implying a 50% or so increase sequentially into 4Q. I'm just trying to frame exactly how you're thinking about the cadence of what 4Q looks like, underpinning that expectation.\n\nAnd then following up on that as well, how have you guys managed through, with that ramp in mind, the supply chain side? I know that your manufacturing partners talked about expanding their capacity significantly. Just curious of what you're seeing as far as being able to fulfill that degree of demand as we look into, not just this quarter but into 4Q."

        "Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. My first one is on the data center business as well. And I just wanted to follow up on the Q3 to Q4 dynamic.\n\nAnd I do apologize if I missed this, but in the implied growth rate in data center in Q4, can you speak to what percentage of supercomputing? I think there is a big project that's slated to ship in Q4. And is there any contribution from the Instinct series outside of supercomputing as well or is it primary your server CPU franchise?\n\nAnd then shifting gears a little bit and follow-up question on the client side. You talked about the business returning to profitability in Q3, which is great.\n\nBut you're still well below where you were in '21 and '22 from an operating margin perspective. Can you speak to the competitive landscape in the client business? Is there a path back to, call it, 20%, 30% operating margins there? And do you have any cost initiatives ongoing to get you back to that level of profitability in client? Thank you."

        "Yes. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Good to see the quarter-over-quarter inflection in your EPYC business targeted at enterprise customers. I think you did mention a continued muted environment in enterprise.\n\nBut the team continues to drive share gains with global corporations, you're ramping Genoa. Are you anticipating your enterprise segment to contribute to the strong second-half growth profile of your data center business?\n\nAnd then on the accelerated compute, general purpose compute demand might be muted in China, but there is a significant amount of unmet demand for accelerated compute in this region. And I know there were performance thresholds put in place last year, and maybe U.S. government might lower that performance threshold again soon, I'm not sure. But let's say barring that, has the team looked into developing China-specific SKUs, if they are MI250 or your new MI300 platforms? It seems like the opportunity here is quite large."

        "Thank you for taking my question. The first one, just a clarification, would it be reasonable to assume that your GPU accelerator sales could be about, say, $500-ish million this year, so about 7%, 8% of data center sales? And if that is the right number, does it mean your server CPU sales are effectively flattish year on year this year?\n\nAnd for my follow-up, just kind of a broader question on AI accelerators in the commercial market, so I'm excluding the Supercomputing, the El Capitan projects, etc. What is AMD's specific edge in this market? You know there are already strong and established kind of merchant players, there are a number of ASIC options, a number of your traditional competitors, Intel and others, and several start-ups are also ramping. So, my question is, what is AMD's specific niche in this market? What is your value proposition and how sustainable is it? Because you're just starting to sample the product now.\n\nSo, I'm trying to get some realistic sense of how big it can be and what the specific kind of niche and differentiation is for AMD in this market."

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first go back to the Q4 data center guide. So, if I do my math right, it's something like $700 million sequentially in data center from Q3 to Q4.\n\nSo, how much of that is MI300 versus CPU? And given the lumpiness of the El Capitan piece, what does that imply for the potential seasonality into Q1 as most of it rolls off?\n\nBut of the $700 million, it's like $400 million of it El Capitan or is it $500 million or $300 million? Like how big is the El Capitan piece?\n\nAnd then following up on that, just gross margins coming up in the back in the second. I mean, they still kind of missed in the quarter. I know they rounded up to 50%, but they were 49.7%.\n\nI know you're guiding 51 for Q3. Jean, where do you see gross margins sitting like in Q4 as we exit the year?"

And is that decline a function of the common infrastructure market or are you seeing weakness beyond that part of the market?\n\nAnd any sense for beyond this quarter, since we've asked you so many Q4 questions already today, but any sense is that kind of the bottom level or do you expect there to be some continued contraction?"

Before this, normalized inventory days were kind of 90 to 100 days.\n\nWhere do you think you're going to exit Q4 in terms of inventory days?\n\nAnd then my follow-up is for you, Lisa. I mean, if you kind of add up the units, the customer interest, you can easily get to several hundred thousand units, it seems to me, for the MI300X next year. So, the question really is on the supply chain, and particularly Cohost, do you think that's going to be a bottleneck for you? I know that, you know, they've been expanding capacity.\n\nI know you've been trying to procure more there. Can you sort of talk about that and sort of do you think that supply could become a limiting factor you next year? Thanks."

I was wondering if perhaps you could put a time frame around that multibillion-dollar opportunity but more specifically, have you guys ported over MI300 LLMs to MI300? Have you looked at the performance? Are you excited about that? And then, in terms of hyperscale uptake, is it the X version, the GPU-only version, that you expect to be the biggest seller here? And have you had any semi-custom kind of configurations here that potentially might even include an FPGA or other kind of Lego movements on the MI300? Thank you.\n\nAnd just as a quick follow-up, then, Siena Telco is a market kind of owned by your competitor there. They have a lot of software around Telco.

Would that still be gross margin accretive or dilutive or net neutral to your corporate gross margin?\n\nAnd then for my follow-up, I just had, I guess, clarification. So, it sounds like most of the MI revenue you have in the hopper right now for at least the committed revenue is LCAP. Is that true? And do you have other, I guess, confirmed or hard orders for that, or maybe just spend some time telling us how you're working with the customers or what it takes for them to go from, \"Hey, we are interested,\" to, \"Here is the purchase order?\""

Do you think that there is a theoretical limit to the share that AMD can get? Historically initially we heard 80-20 was a pervading rule, and then you busted through that. Now, we are hearing customers say 70-30 is more like it. More importantly, are there any large vendors for your server business where you have significantly more than 30% share, let's say, 40% or even 50% share? And I have a follow-up.\n\nOn my second one, can you help us think a little bit about the generative AI spend, let's say, if you can side press some kind of metric, and so, how many dollars of spend today are you seeing from your customers on generative AI for let's say each dollar of regular server CPU spend? Is there a metric that we can think of? Is there a trend today? And where do you think it can be in a couple of years."
