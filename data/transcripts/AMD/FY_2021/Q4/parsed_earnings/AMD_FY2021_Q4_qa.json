          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Blayne. As it relates to the fourth quarter and where we are overall very pleased with our performance in terms of the second half of the year. It's playing out about what we expect it to be in the PC market. So as you're asking about computing and graphics. We had seen that the PC market and user demand is strong overall, but there are some matched set constraints in the PC market. And so for that reason, we've called the PC market really flattish. I would not have said down. I would have called it flattish as we look into the fourth quarter. However, as we look overall at the business, I think the data center business has performed very well, and we see strong demand there, and we're continuing to see that. And as well, the console business, overall gaming is also quite strong. And so we see growth in servers and semi-custom as we go into the fourth quarter. And then on the margin dynamics, Devinder, do you want to cover that?"

          "topic": "Data Center Spending Environment and Competition",
          "content": "Yeah. So thanks, Vivek, for the question. I think overall, we're feeling very, very good about the server business or the data center market. I think from a market standpoint, we've seen a strong market year in 2021 in both cloud and enterprise and we see that continuing into 2022. I think from a competitive position standpoint, I think Milan is extremely well-positioned. So we were very pleased with sort of the adoption rate of Milan. We said that we expected it to grow faster than Rome, and it has. And so the crossover with Milan and Rome in the third quarter is an important metric for that. Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see a strong environment. And then as the competitive environment goes into 2022, we always expect the competition to be strong, but our focus has been consistent execution of our road map, and we feel very good about Zen 4 and Genoa in 2022. I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning there. And we continue to believe that data center is the most strategic part of our business, and we're making good progress with our customers and partners."

          "content": "Yeah. So, again, what I would say is our data center business performed very well in the third quarter, that was across both cloud and enterprise. And in cloud, that was across geographies. So we haven't seen anything particular as it relates to China or there. What I would say is we continue to work with the breadth of customers. And we're in the process of really rolling out sort of broader adoption across the customer set. So I think we saw a pretty normal environment for demand."

You know, we -- as you said, this is an area where, you know, we're early in the cycle. It's an area where we're building relationships. And so, you know, I feel good about the progress there but, you know, I would say it's still quite early. And then, you know, you didn't ask this, but just one of the other things with the communications and 5G, you know, as we bring Xilinx into the equation, you know, they also have very deep relationships with a number of these accounts. And so, you know, we see that as an incremental positive as we think about EPYC in communications."

          "topic": "Data Center GPU Size and Ramp",
          "content": "Sure. So Stacy, on the data center GPU side, the third quarter was a larger quarter for the data center GPU. This is where we shipped the Frontier shipments that are now in the build cycle. It is still a relatively small business compared to the CPU side. So our expectation is that going into the fourth quarter, it's a lumpy business for us. So Q3 was a strong quarter given the shipments of -- for Frontier. We would expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, that it will be down sequentially quarter on quarter. But still, it's a strong growth year overall for a business that we think is a significant strategic growth driver for us over the next few years."

It's a focus for this year for both our server road map, as well as our client road map. And then the work with the Infinity Fabric really is just on top of that and allows us to continue to optimize, you know, sort of the AMD CPU and GPU ecosystem together. So whether on the data center side, with our data center GPU products, you know, working with EPYC in high-performance computing or on the PC side, when we have our, you know, AMD APUs plus our discrete graphics, you know, plus the software on top. So it is an important -- very important element of our strategy, and it just goes to continuing to differentiate with the overall portfolio as we go into these new platforms."

With our next-generation GPU architecture, MI200, which we'll be talking about in the next few weeks, we've made significant investments in progress. Our focus has been on using the Frontier beachhead with high-performance computing and expanding that into AI, working with our partners on software development. The Xilinx acquisition brings in software talent and provides opportunities to optimize across the portfolio in terms of software infrastructure that the ecosystem wants. It's a very strategic area we're making good progress in."

          "topic": "Client Computing and Graphics Segment",
          "content": "Yeah. So, you know, our focus in this segment is to be very closely aligned with our customers and what they're doing in the market. So we've been monitoring, you know, sell-in and sell-out and sell-through trends very carefully. I think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was very much a result of, you know, sort of the product strength. And we saw, you know, very nice notebook demand continuing at the premium part of the market in commercial, gaming, premium ultrathin. So we believe that the PC performance was, you know, a bit above our original guidance, but we believe that was to match end-user demand. Going into 2022, you know, same story. I think the -- you know, what we see is 2021 was a strong year for PCs. Overall, the industry shipped, you know, approximately 350 million units. I think our view is that 2022 will be roughly flattish from a unit standpoint. But we will see a -- some mix, you know, changes in there with enterprise and premium being stronger than, for example, low end and education. So, you know, from our standpoint, it's revenue share that we believe we can gain. It's the strength of our Ryzen 6000 series that we just launched at CES. We have, you know, 200 platforms from all of the OEM customers, and we have pretty good visibility in working with our customers on that. So -- and I think we feel good about it. You know -- and, again, the client business is one of all of our businesses, you know, will grow. And I like that diversity, frankly, in the portfolio. But we feel good about the progress we've made in PCs, and we'll continue to ensure that we're matching sell-in with sell-out so that there is not inventory build in the business."

          "content": "I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'll say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observed, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47% to 48%. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the strength of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there. The product mix is important. The ramp in the data center and the client PC business as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So I feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time."

So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that."

          "content": "Yeah. I think, fundamentally, and what you observe is right, very disciplined from an opex standpoint, investing in the growth is important. Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an opex standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company. And I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in opex will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, opex flattish or even down. I mean you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top priority for us."

I imagine, seven-nanometer capacity won't go away. It will stay as that new capacity comes online. So I just want to make sure I understand all the variables around the confidence in supply.",
        "I've been hearing more and more, and as you guys roll out the five-nanometer portfolio, many of those products in server and in desktop will include next-generation Infinity Fabric. And it's been a conversation for a while about what you guys have branded sort of A+ A, AMD CPU, and GPU together. I wonder as you look out over the next several quarters, how -- Lisa, how would you characterize that combination in importance to your company strategy and the growth?"

So in the near term, what changed? And perhaps more importantly, as you look into 2022, it appears that you're planning for significant share gains to continue in that sector. Can you talk a little bit about what gives the confidence for that share gain, please?",
        "Just a quick follow-up on the pricing side of the equation. You talked about getting enough supply to grow the impressive targets that you guys have for the year. Conceptually and strategically, how do you think about pricing? Is that something you pass along? Is it a tailwind to gross margin? And I don't know if you'd give any sort of precision, but out of the 30% plus that you're guiding to for the fiscal year, roughly, how do we think about pricing as a tailwind within that?"

They seem to be very excited about that. You know, they're adding a lot of capacity in their fabs. Their enterprise spending, which has tended to favor them in the past, right, is also coming back. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking about AMD's ability to gain more share in servers this year?",
        "You know, the semiconductor industry just went through a very tough time last year and even into this year, given all the supply shortages. I'm curious, what has that done to help you build, you know, stronger relationships with your customers who are perhaps looking for a more consistent execution on the road map and more reliable sources of supply? So how is, you know, the shortage environment in semis changed the way customers are looking at AMD today than, you know, how they used to look at you historically?"

But in the event that come mid-year that were to change and perhaps be a little bit worse than thought, do you have the ability to rejigger your sort of supply chain to move toward server and CPU? How does that kind of math work?",

So I guess the question is, like, is that a reasonable trajectory into next year? As if we're sitting to 12 months from now, would you be surprised if you gained another 500 basis points next year?
