          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Blayne. As it relates to the fourth quarter and where we are overall very pleased with our performance in terms of the second half of the year. It's playing out about what we expect it to be in the PC market. So as you're asking about computing and graphics. We had seen that the PC market and user demand is strong overall, but there are some matched set constraints in the PC market. And so for that reason, we've called the PC market really flattish. I would not have said down. I would have called it flattish as we look into the fourth quarter. However, as we look overall at the business, I think the data center business has performed very well, and we see strong demand there, and we're continuing to see that. And as well, the console business, overall gaming is also quite strong. And so we see growth in servers and semi-custom as we go into the fourth quarter. And then on the margin dynamics, Devinder, do you want to cover that?"

          "topic": "Data Center Spending Environment and Competition",
          "content": "Yeah. So thanks, Vivek, for the question. I think overall, we're feeling very, very good about the server business or the data center market. I think from a market standpoint, we've seen a strong market year in 2021 in both cloud and enterprise and we see that continuing into 2022. I think from a competitive position standpoint, I think Milan is extremely well-positioned. So we were very pleased with sort of the adoption rate of Milan. We said that we expected it to grow faster than Rome, and it has. And so the crossover with Milan and Rome in the third quarter is an important metric for that. Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see a strong environment. And then as the competitive environment goes into 2022, we always expect the competition to be strong, but our focus has been consistent execution of our road map, and we feel very good about Zen 4 and Genoa in 2022. I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning there. And we continue to believe that data center is the most strategic part of our business, and we're making good progress with our customers and partners."

          "topic": "Server Business in China",
          "content": "Yeah. So, again, what I would say is our data center business performed very well in the third quarter, that was across both cloud and enterprise. And in cloud, that was across geographies. So we haven't seen anything particular as it relates to China or there. What I would say is we continue to work with the breadth of customers. And we're in the process of really rolling out sort of broader adoption across the customer set. So I think we saw a pretty normal environment for demand."

          "topic": "Google's Tau Instances with Milan",
          "content": "Yeah. So, look, what I would say it is we're seeing lots of different use cases for the processors. And there are some use cases where you're more focused on performance per dollar than overall performance. And you might choose to optimize how you configure the processor differently. I think what you'll see from us is we're spending a lot of time with our hyperscale partners to offer them the type of incidence that they need and their customers need. So you'll see us do more customization across the board to satisfy that range of performance across all use cases. But we're being very thoughtful in ensuring that we have the right product for the right workload and that it's optimized for performance, power, and cost."
        },
        {
          "topic": "PC Market Outlook and Supply Matching",
          "content": "Yeah. So look, there are lots of different signals in the PC market. So what we're doing is taking various different scenarios into account. From our point of view, we believe that there is strong growth momentum across the portfolio. And we believe that we will grow in the PC business as well even if the market is not as robust as some might forecast. Our view is that we're still underrepresented across the markets we play in, whether data center, PCs, or gaming. On the PC side, we're making very good progress in commercial, premium gaming notebooks, and premium consumer segments. We have more platforms coming with Ryzen 5000 and the next generation. Our outlook is less dependent on what exactly happens in the market, but we watch the market closely and work with our OEM partners to stay in tune with their needs."

        {
          "topic": "Console Business Seasonality",
          "content": "Sure, Joe. So the console business, we're quite early in the console cycle, and I think you've seen that there's very strong demand for those products. And so I think the seasonality is not typical. Typically, we see the second half stronger than the first half, and that is sort of more muted this year. So there is some growth into the second half of the year, but it's not nearly what it is in a typical console seasonality."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Graphics Business and Crypto Exposure",
          "content": "Yeah. So the graphics business did have a strong third quarter. I think that's true for graphics gaming, as well as data center GPU. The portfolio we have with RDNA 2 has turned out really well. We're pleased with how it's positioned competitively in the marketplace. Gaming has been a secular trend with very strong demand. In terms of crypto, our view is that it's really negligible revenue for us in the third quarter. It's not a segment we have been servicing. We've tried to keep our gaming graphics focused on gamers. We've been able to increase some of the supply for graphics, which contributed to the sequential growth we saw. Going into the fourth quarter next year, we see gaming as a strong segment, and the product set is very good."

        {
          "topic": "Software Efforts and Xilinx Integration",
          "content": "Sure, Tim. So, yes, we continue to invest heavily in software, particularly on the data center GPU side. With our next-generation GPU architecture, MI200, which we'll be talking about in the next few weeks, we've made significant investments in progress. Our focus has been on using the Frontier beachhead with high-performance computing and expanding that into AI, working with our partners on software development. The Xilinx acquisition brings in software talent and provides opportunities to optimize across the portfolio in terms of software infrastructure that the ecosystem wants. It's a very strategic area we're making good progress in."

        {
          "topic": "Server Share Gains and Future Trajectory",
          "content": "Yeah. So overall, our server trajectory has been very strong. We're very pleased with the trajectory in 2021. Having multiple quarters where we're doubling revenue year on year speaks to the progress. Going into 2022, we still believe we are a share gainer given the strength of our portfolio and platforms yet to launch. We're continuing to play out the strategy of data center being a place where our technology is very differentiated. We're focused on ensuring that Zen 4 and Genoa are similarly well-positioned in the marketplace."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Progress and Guidance",
          "content": "I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'll say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observed, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47% to 48%. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the strength of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there. The product mix is important. The ramp in the data center and the client PC business as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So I feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Gross Margin Composition and Target",
          "content": "So the only thing I'll add, Ross, I think as you know, the situation is pretty tight, as we talked about the overall global supply situation in semiconductors. So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Opex Guidance and Investment",
          "content": "Yeah. I think, fundamentally, and what you observe is right, very disciplined from an opex standpoint, investing in the growth is important. Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an opex standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company. And I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in opex will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, opex flattish or even down. I mean you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top priority for us."

        "Just kind of curious, the overall outlook for Q4. So computing graphics being down. I was just curious if that was more the supply. You're still growing sequentially. And obviously, I would assume you prioritize servers. Just kind of curious what you're seeing in the computing graphics market. And is it anything related to supply constraints for you that would be down sequentially or maybe downstream constraints? And then maybe for Devinder. Just curious, you're still growing gross margin. I'm assuming embedded, semi-custom, and service kind of offsetting. So just kind of walk us through the nice increase in gross margin for Q4."

        "Lisa, how are you feeling about the spending environment in the data center as you look over the next several quarters? And especially your server road map versus the competition because they are planning to launch several new and important products early next year. So I was just wondering how you're thinking about the competitive landscape and the spending landscape over the next year.",
        "AMD has done very well in terms of gaining share at the hyperscalers. Where are you in that journey? Is there still a lot of share gains to be had at hyperscalers? And importantly, can you repeat that in the enterprise? Or do you think your competitors' incumbency limits the share gain opportunity in the enterprise?"

Your competitor called out China and some of the turmoil that's gone over there as a reason why some of their cloud business had some headwinds in the third quarter. And maybe you could comment on how you see spending over the last quarter and then in the next couple of quarters, specifically in that end market in China.",
        "You guys mentioned in the comments, still plans to get the Xilinx deal closed by the end of the year. And I think that's important as then there's a lot of things that you can talk about more, maybe more openly about the heterogeneous compute strategy for the business over the long term. Maybe you could walk us through to the extent that you can talk about it, obviously, there are some things that you can't talk about. But to the extent you can, what milestones you've achieved behind the scenes that make you feel confident, and what hurdles are still there to have the confidence?"

        "First is just a clarification. I think you said in your prepared comments relative to the June quarter that EPYC grew solidly double digits sequentially. The overall segment grew about 19%. I'm just curious, did EPYC outgrow the overall segment? Or was it more in line? Can you give us a sense of how it did relative to the segment?",
        "My second question is just more of a strategic question around pricing. Clearly, last week, on their conference call, Intel talked about perhaps being a little bit more price aggressive, especially in data center, to protect share. And I'd like to get kind of your thought on pricing. I mean in my mind, that market is much more about a total cost of ownership than an entry point. And given your price performance, I'm just kind of curious as to how concerned you are about the pricing environment and how concerned you think we should be over time."

        "With Milan on a strong ramp trajectory and also good to see the momentum in enterprise, as you guys continue to drive EPYC into new markets, just wanted to get an update on the pull in the telco service provider market, right? It's a relatively big market, right? It's about a $6 billion, $7 billion market. Milan supports much more networking functionality versus prior generations. And operators continue to virtualize the core of their networks. And with 5G, they're also starting to virtualize their radio access networks. And so just wanted to see if the team is seeing early momentum with Milan with telco equipment OEMs, as well as with some of the large 5G service providers.",
        "On the strong early momentum in enterprise as you move into the second half and as you probably have some visibility into next year because the enterprise call cycles are probably a bit longer than some of your cloud customers, can you just talk about the breadth of the engagements in enterprise across large corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses?"

        "So server share, if I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like you're going to be in the 12.5% to 13% share, if I use the entire TAM, and that's up like 500 basis points versus last year Q4. So I guess the question is, like, is that a reasonable trajectory into next year? As if we're sitting to 12 months from now, would you be surprised if you gained another 500 basis points next year? And sort of where do you think about where that share can go?"
