          "content": "Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So we are -- we started the year very strong, very pleased with the first-quarter performance and what we see overall for the year. So we are increasing our full-year guidance. We exceeded in the first quarter. We guided up in the second quarter, and then that's carrying through to the second half of the year. What we've seen is the following. We came into the year with an overall strong demand picture, and that was certainly true. What we've seen over the last 90 days is consistent strong demand, very strong visibility from our customers on what they need throughout the year. Particularly, you asked about data center. I think we saw actually strong signals in the first quarter that it would be a strong data center year for us. We're on a product ramp cycle. We launched new products in PCs on the mobile side with our Ryzen 5000. We launched new products on the graphics side with Radeon 6000. And then the launch of the third-generation Milan has actually gone very, very well. So in terms of what we see, we see very strong demand for our products. We see good customer ordering patterns and strong backlog. And then we have also seen that the supply chain has been tight overall for the semiconductor industry. And we've been working very closely with our supply chain partners. And so we also have good visibility to additional supply as we go throughout the year. So with all that in place, I would say we feel very good about how the year is shaping up. In terms of where you see the strength overall, I would say it's strength across all businesses. But particularly the strength in data center is good. And we also see just, again, very good visibility and very close working relationships with our customers. You asked about crypto. We do not -- we have negligible crypto in here. So this is really the foundational business, really, the new products and just seeing the customers adopt and ramp quickly."

        {
          "topic": "Supply Constraints and Gross Margins",
          "content": "Yeah. I would say, Vivek, it's still early in the year. So the entire semiconductor supply chain is very, very tight. I think you hear that from all of our peers in the marketplace. That being said, we've been working very closely with our supply chain partners. We have seen improvements that have led to the improved full-year guide. We're going to continue to work on that because right now, I would say the channel -- the inventories are very low throughout the entire supply chain, whether you talk about at our customers or in the channels. And so there's quite more that we would like to be able to do. That being the case, I think we continue to work well with our partners and take lots of actions there. As it relates to overall costs and things like that, we are watching those things, I think, from logistics and some of the component costs and things like that. So there's -- mostly the gross margin guidance is reflective of the fact that we do have ramping of our new products. And we also have some ramp of the gaming products, which are a little bit below corporate average. But we'll see how things progress as we go throughout the year."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Data Center Performance and Product Ramps",
          "content": "Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when we look at the data center business, it's a very strategic focus for us. And with EPYC with each generation, we've really tried to expand the reach. I think here in the first quarter, what we saw is very strong results, doubling year over year. It is on the strength of cloud. But what we saw was both Rome ramping, so we saw Rome units up sequentially, and we also saw Milan ramping. And what that says, this is what we expected. We actually expected that we had a good footprint in Rome and that that would continue to be well deployed as we come into the first half of this year, and that's played out. And then Milan is just a very, very good product. I mean, it's extremely well-positioned. Not only do we have per socket leadership, but we have per core leadership, which, again, expands the footprint. So in terms of your question about cloud versus enterprise, we were more cloud-weighted in the first quarter as some of those instances, both internal and external, ramped. We would expect that enterprise, both enterprise, as well as HPC deployments, will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. But we'll see Rome and Milan in the market together all through this year, and we expect strong adoption on the enterprise side."

          "topic": "Gaming Graphics Business",
          "content": "Yeah. So the consumer graphics or the gaming graphics business, as you talked about, has actually done well for us. It grew double digits this past quarter. We had a very deliberate strategy here with the launch of RDNA 2. We started at the top of the stack with our Big Navi product. And then we've now introduced a couple of additional products. And you'll see that both from the channel, sort of adding board cards into more OEM systems and notebook business as well as additional variants. So it's an important market segment for us. We're happy with the progress. I think gamers really appreciate the product. It's fair to say that the graphics demand is very high across the marketplace. So we've actually put quite a bit of product into the market, but the demand still exceeds supply. You'll see that increase as we go through the second half of the year. And overall, I think the progress that we've made with RDNA 2 is fantastic, and we continue to believe that gaming overall is a great secular growth story."

So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that."

        "Lisa, you're guiding -- you're increasing the full-year guidance by almost $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Could you give us some sense of what has changed in the last three months? Because your competitor was recently talking about cloud digestion, and you're raising guidance by $1.3 billion. So I'm curious what changed in the last three months? And if you could help us parse which products or end markets are contributing to this increase, how much from servers or PC or semi-customer, or if there is any crypto impact. So any color on what's driving this really strong guidance and increase for the year would be very helpful."

You basically saw no seasonality in March, and it seems like it's not growing much in June. So just maybe just -- is that still impacted by maybe not your shortages or other shortages? And just any perspective on that business for the year.",
        "And then I just want to ask you on the competitive landscape on the client side. You clearly gained a couple of points of share in March. Intel was talking about they're being more aggressive on their percent of 10-nanometer product. Maybe just talk about the competitive landscape as you look through the rest of the year. And are you seeing any change to that landscape as they ramp 10-nanometer?"

But I'm curious of where we stand today as far as more of the traditional OEMs, the progression of their systems. I think you've said 100-plus systems. When do you think that those will all be shipping in the market? And how would you put the context of Milan relative to Rome on that front? And I have a follow-up.",

And I noticed you highlighted in the release and in the slides where you are in several different verticals in design wins on enterprise notebook in the Fortune 500. And I wonder if you might speak a little bit about the relationships that you're building with the big enterprise customers. Do you have FAE support, software support, firmware support, etc.? Do you have the right people in place to really ramp that business more materially going forward? Thanks.",
        "For my follow-up, it's a bit unrelated. One of the businesses that maybe you've not had supply or there's been other parts of the business growing much more quickly, I wanted to ask a bit about gaming. The new RDNA 2 architecture, I think, brings some new features, but obviously, there's a strong incumbent competitor in the gaming market. Maybe you could just talk about where you are competitively right now, how you see supply coming online that might support that gaming franchise a bit better, and just maybe the lay of the land and gaming right now. Because it's one piece of the business that everything else is going so well, I think there are some opportunities there. Thanks."

You talked about production ramping in the second half of this year. You talked a little bit about Frontier as well. But what kind of customer pull are you seeing in your data center GPU business? And then I got a quick follow-up.",
        "And then I wanted to ask about the potential threat from ARM longer term. Within x86, obviously, you've got significant runway from a market share perspective. But how are you thinking about the potential threat from ARM-based processors, both in your client business, as well as your server business? You've got Apple obviously internalizing some of their CPUs on the client side, hyper-scalers talking about internal solutions. And your closest GPU competitor launched -- or introduced rather ARM-based CPU multiple years out. So any thoughts on ARM versus x86 and how you address that would be helpful."

        "Maybe I can ask Ross's gross margin question a little bit differently. I would kind of argue given the -- the -- the mix in the December quarter and the fact that it was the first quarter of the console ramp that the gross margins you were able to put up were -- were -- were quite good. And I'm kind of just trying to understand how we should think about gross margins ex-console? And as we think about '21 unfold, typically in the console business, gross margins start relatively low, but there is good improvement over time. And so what's kind of the exit rate of gross margins in your 47 full-year guide? And I guess why isn't it higher? It might just be that you guys are being conservative, but it seems like you got a lot of tailwinds as the year unfolds.",
        "And then, as my follow-up, it's pretty clear that semiconductors are becoming much more strategic to -- to nation states and -- and world governments and there's a lot of speculation that your chief competitor is -- is lobbying Washington pretty hard to get some incentives for domestic manufacturing. I'm just kind of curious how -- how you're trying to be part of that conversation because, clearly, given the IP portfolio you have, given the share that you're taking, I -- I would argue you're as much a national champion as anyone in semis, but it does seem like the focus is on manufacturing. So -- so how do you kind of get the year of Washington to make them understand how important you are in this whole mix?"

        "Lisa, I guess you had indicated you believe -- I believe you said you thought you gained share in the server market. My back of the envelope calculation suggests you gained at least 2 points of share in service, which is an acceleration on my estimate of about 1% share gain a quarter over the previous four quarters. So I guess can you tell me if my math is materially off? And if not, is this a new higher rate of share gains? And what would you chop this up to? Are you guys at a tipping point? Are your customers at a tipping point for embracing AMD as a supplier? Do they have increased comfort? Or is your ecosystem for support? Can you just maybe just give us a higher-level picture about where you think your customers are and really embracing and ramping up your server offerings at a higher rate. And I have a follow-up if I may.",
        "And then a follow-up on -- just coming back to ARM. You -- they -- you answered the previous questions with kind of talking about embracing the idea of having heterogeneous architectures in semi-custom and working with your customers to develop solutions. But if I go back, AMD had an ARM server offering before. Can you give us an update on the state of that ARM server IP? Is that something that you can resurrect? Or have you've been keeping it, the development working on that? And can you discuss -- are your customers asking for your help in delivering semi-custom solutions that have an ARM component to it? Because from what I can tell, it looks like three cloud service providers have ARM server offerings in their platform, but there's a lot that don't and don't have quite the development capabilities. So I was hoping if you could just talk more specifically about the IP that you had. And are you bringing that back if your customers are asking for it? Thank you."

        "Just had a question competitively on the GPU side of things, more so on the traditional client side of the equation. You've done a great job taking a ton of share in the CPU side. Sounds like you're optimistic about what the client GPU business is going to do in 2021. Can you just walk us through some of the differences, some of the opportunities, and or challenges of taking share in the GPU market versus where you've already succeeded so much in -- in, well, continue to on the CPU side of things?",
        "And then as my follow-up, one for either you or Devinder on the gross margin, you gave the shorter term answer for the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but I want to ask one about 2021 as a whole. It's good to see that it's rising again up to that 47% target. I just want to walk through the puts and takes on that. And I guess the core question is if the semi-custom business is going to grow substantially as a percentage of your revenues, what's offsetting that to have the gross margin rise year over year? Is it mixed between segments? So server, for example, is going to keep up with that? Or is there something within the segments that is also improving, whether it be in semi-custom, or graphics, or some area like that?"

I know it was both Rome and Milan grew. But how much of the actual growth, the $100 million-plus sequentially that must have been EPYC, how much of that growth, how did that split out between Rome and Milan? Was it like the majority of the growth of that was Milan? And how do you see Milan as a percentage of a data center CPU mix in Q2?",

I mean your -- your competitor is actually talk quite actively about a more competitive environment for servers. We're actually starting to see some impacts on their ASPs and their margins. What are you seeing -- I guess what did you see in terms of server pricing, specifically those kind of trends in the quarter, and what are you incorporating in your guidance for the pricing environment in data center in 2021?",

        "And then I want to ask a question about opex. So I know the model you gave at the analyst day had a midpoint for opex revenue of 26.5%. I know you're running ahead of revenue and everything right now. But if I sort of back out the second-half implied guidance for opex, it actually is at that 26.5% run rate in the second half to get to 26% for the full year. Should we think about, I guess, it's like as we go into 2022, do you think you're sort of at the model opex run rate, that sort of like more than 26%, 26.5% on whatever the revenue is? Is that the right way to think about the opex trajectory going forward? And I guess like -- do you think you're actually spending enough at this point, given where you're taking the road map? Are you spending at the right levels right now to ensure that that road map is actually cemented and firm?"

It sounds like server CPU share is running like 12.5% on your $20 million TAM-based that you use. So you have Milan ramping and you're talking about a lot of visibility on that ramp this year. So I'm sort of wondering if maybe you can give us what your guidance implies or sort of what the next milepost to think of would be in terms of server CPU share as you sort of exit the year and maybe look into next year?",

Can you just sort of maybe give us some sense in terms of how much you think it could grow? I mean could it double year over year? I understand it's not big from a dollar point of view, but could it double year over year? Maybe just talk about how big Frontier could be as a contributor to that business? Thanks.",
        "I wanted to ask also about share gains. You've done a great job this year in both client and in data center. At the same time as was referenced before, Intel's tone is definitely changing. They use the word leveraging relationships. And they talked about other tactics to sort of stem or arrest some of the share losses and they're now offering x86 cores via foundry and things like that. So I guess the question is sort of beyond this year because the competitive environment this year is pretty much set. So do you think we can extrapolate the success you've had this year into '22 and '23? Or do you think the competitive environment will intensify in the next few years? Thanks.",
