          "content": "Sure. Well, thanks for the question. I think it's fair to say that the semiconductor demand environment and particularly the AMD demand environment has been very strong in 2021. We've been working on supply for the past couple of quarters. I think I'm actually quite pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of increasing our supply. And what I've said previously is, certainly, we do see some level of constraints, but we are making progress each quarter. And we made progress in the second quarter that enabled us to exceed the original guidance. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're continuing to bring on extra supply each quarter, which is leading to the full-year guidance raise that we have. So I think overall, we continue to make progress. I will say that it's tight, like you've heard from many other companies, through the end of this year. I think it improves in 2022. We've been planning for significant growth. Our model is one where we're going to drive significant growth. So we've been planning with that with our supply chain partners. And we do have confidence that we can continue to grow substantially as we go into the second half of this year and into 2022 with the supply chain."

          "topic": "Data Center CPU Business Mix and Second Half Guidance",
          "content": "Sure. Quite a few questions there. So let me try to work through them. So in terms of the makeup of our data center business, I mean our server business was very strong. I think the product capability and sort of just -- sort of the performance and the total cost of ownership for Milan has proven out very well with our customers. So we're very happy with that launch. In the second quarter, we did see significant growth with Milan. And that being the case, Rome was still a larger portion of the revenue. And I would say in the second quarter, it was more cloud-weighted. So we saw cloud tends to ramp faster on new generation, and that was the case in the second quarter. So cloud grew faster than enterprise. As we go into the second half of the year, we expect that Milan will ramp very quickly and cross over -- third gen will cross over second-generation in the third quarter. And what we're seeing actually is continued strength across cloud and HPC, which have been traditionally strong for AMD. But we're actually seeing very good momentum in enterprise. And I think with the breadth of the platforms that we have out there and just sort of the coverage and then sort of the per core performance, as well as the overall socket level performance, we're getting a very strong traction, and we're pleased to see that. So I think as we go into the second half of the year, I think enterprise will be a stronger component for us than it was in the first half of the year, and that's the balance that we want. But overall, we're pleased with that. And then in terms of your question about server was -- I'm sorry, data center was greater than 20% of our revenue in the second quarter. We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year. And so it will be a larger percentage of our overall revenue in the second half of the year."

          "topic": "Gaming Graphics Business",
          "content": "Yeah. So the consumer graphics or the gaming graphics business, as you talked about, has actually done well for us. It grew double digits this past quarter. We had a very deliberate strategy here with the launch of RDNA 2. We started at the top of the stack with our Big Navi product. And then we've now introduced a couple of additional products. And you'll see that both from the channel, sort of adding board cards into more OEM systems and notebook business as well as additional variants. So it's an important market segment for us. We're happy with the progress. I think gamers really appreciate the product. It's fair to say that the graphics demand is very high across the marketplace. So we've actually put quite a bit of product into the market, but the demand still exceeds supply. You'll see that increase as we go through the second half of the year. And overall, I think the progress that we've made with RDNA 2 is fantastic, and we continue to believe that gaming overall is a great secular growth story."

          "topic": "Console Business and Seasonality",
          "content": "Sure, Joe. So the console business, we're quite early in the console cycle, and I think you've seen that there's very strong demand for those products. And so I think the seasonality is not typical. So typically, we see the second half stronger than the first half, and that is sort of more muted this year. So there is some growth into the second half of the year, but it's not nearly what it is in a typical console seasonality."

          "topic": "Google's Tau Instances and AMD's Positioning",
          "content": "Sure. So, look, the way I would say it is this, and again, I want to be a little bit sort of broad in how I answer the question. I think what you see in the server land is that there are lots of different use cases for the processors. And you have some that are looking for sort of the bleeding-edge performance. And there, the multi-threading is very, very useful. And you get better performance per watt, performance per dollar and just overall socket-level performance. I think what we've seen is that as you look across use cases, there are some use cases where you're more focused on performance per dollar than overall performance. And you might choose to optimize sort of what you do, sort of how you configure the processor differently. I think what you'll see from us, Mark, is we're spending a lot of time with our hyperscale partners. And what we want to do is offer them the type of incidence that they need and that their customers need. So you'll see us do more customization across the board with the idea of we want to satisfy that range of performance that -- across sort of the entire range of use cases. So I think we'll talk more about how we think about the road map as we go forward. But I will say that we're being very thoughtful in ensuring that we have the right product for the right workload and that it's optimized for performance and power and cost in all those areas."

          "topic": "PC Market Outlook and Supply/Demand",
          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Stacy. So look, I think -- I mean there are lots of different signals in the PC market for 2022. So I think what we're doing is taking, let's call it -- we're planning for various different scenarios. But I would say that from our point of view, the overall answer to your question is yes. I mean we believe that there is a -- we have strong growth momentum across the portfolio. And we believe that we will -- we can grow in the PC business as well even if the market is, let's call it, not as robust as some might forecast. Our view is that we're still underrepresented across the board in the markets that we play in, whether you're talking about data center or PCs or gaming. And on the PC side, in particular, we're making very good progress in sort of commercial, premium gaming notebooks, premium consumer. We have more platforms coming with our Ryzen 5000 and our next generation. So I think our sort of outlook is less dependent on what exactly happens in the market. But obviously, we watch the market very closely, and we work with our OEM partners very closely to stay in tune with what they're seeing."

          "topic": "Data Center GPU Customer Pull and ARM Threat",
          "content": "Yeah, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. We're making very nice progress in the data center GPU business. It's in the investment mode now, so we're investing heavily in the business. We launched the CDNA architecture or the compute-optimized architecture last year. You'll see updates to that this year as we bring out the next generation with our Frontier systems. The revenue is albeit on the lower side in terms of just size of the business relative to the rest of the business, but we will see growth in the second half this year. And the business here is actually very strategic, right? It's the idea of really putting together heterogeneous systems and bringing our CPU technology with EPYC together with our GPU technology with Instinct with the software capabilities that we have been investing in, and really getting strong HPC systems, as well as AI and machine learning capabilities. So we will see growth in the second half this year. It will still be a smaller business, but we see it growing in this strategic time frame over the next couple of years. And it is very much that end-to-end story of what you need to really satisfy sort of the key workloads in the data center."
        },
        {
          "topic": "ARM vs x86 Threat Outlook",
          "content": "Yeah, so absolutely. I think the key point here is you really have to have a very, very strong product road map, and that is really what we're focused on. I think the overarching trend that computing is becoming very important and so there are additional entrants trying to address different aspects of computing, I think is to be expected. And when you look at the data center, in particular, I think the trend that computing is becoming more workload-optimized is also an important trend. These are the things that we've been thinking about for a long time, and we've been looking at ensuring that we address that in our road map. So our focus is to continue to optimize solutions across the data center and across the PC ecosystem, make sure that what we have is very competitive, addressing what customers' needs are. And we also have the ability to customize solutions as well with our strong IP portfolio. So all that being the case, I think the answer is very competitive market, but we feel very good about the road map that we have in front of us."

          "topic": "PC Market Resilience and Supply Matching",
          "content": "Yeah. So look, there are lots of different signals in the PC market. So maybe I will make a few comments. I think it's fair to say that the end-user demand has been very strong. So very strong in the first half of the year, very strong in the second half of last year. And that's from all this work from home, school from home, sort of, and then some of this return-to-office trends. Within that, there is a little bit of a mix shift as you go through time. When I look at the market, I would say that we've performed very well. Within this market backdrop, we continue to gain revenue share. And what that means is we're focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market. As we go forward, I do agree that end-user demand is strong. I also believe that if you look at the second half of this year for the PC market, you'll hear about sort of pockets of component shortages or match sets and things like that. So we're taking that into account as we think about the second half of the year. From our perspective, we're planning the PC -- our PC business to be about flattish first half into second half. And again, we think that that's very well supported by all of the ordering patterns and all of our sort of look at what the PC OEMs are doing. From an inventory standpoint, we do not believe there is significant inventory. We do track it very closely, of AMD product anyways. We look at it at the retailers, as well as at -- with our OEMs. So I think we have this very -- we're watching it very closely and recognize that the PC market may go up or down. We're expecting it to be -- like I said, for our business roughly flattish first half into second half. And that being the case, we continue to believe that there is strong end user demand and there's just some supply matching that needs to happen in the marketplace."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Progress and Guidance",
          "content": "I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'll say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observed, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47% to 48%. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the strength of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there. The product mix is important. The ramp in the data center and the client PC business as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So I feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time."

          "content": "So the only thing I'll add, Ross, I think as you know, the situation is pretty tight, as we talked about the overall global supply situation in semiconductors. So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that."

          "topic": "Opex Guidance and Investment",
          "content": "Yeah. I think, Stacy, first of all, you hit it right. The priority for this is to invest in the business for growth. We are growing significantly and just took up the guidance. So obviously, there's a lot of areas to invest in to support that growth, whether it's R&D or go-to-market or even hiring. Second half of the year, you also have salary increases that kick in for our employees. And obviously, that does drive the opex higher just given the guide we gave for Q3, which is higher than Q2 from an overall opex standpoint. As far as the numbers are concerned, I know you're probably running your model there, but those numbers are approximate. And really, if you ask me from an overall standpoint, I would expect that for the year, we come in a little under 25%. We gave the approximate guidance of 25%, but I think we'll come in under 25% for the year. Nothing extraordinary there. It's just making sure we plan the business, support the growth and make sure that into 2022, as we have new product introductions that Lisa just talked about, we continue to support that because there are a lot of new products coming into 2022. So really, that's what it is, Stacy."

        "Lisa, one of the things I was really pleased to see in this set of results and investors have asked me about quite a bit is that you're delivering the revenue upside but the operating margin leverage is coming with that. You guys have rightly been spending a ton to grow the business, and that's been reflected in the growth. And I just wonder how you're thinking about the balance of revenue growth versus delivering sort of upside to operating margins going forward because it's an item that's been a fulcrum from some investors in my conversation.",
        "It's interesting, the more strength the PC market shows, it's almost like the more concern investors have that eventually we revert back toward the mean. And Lisa, your competitor gave some fairly bullish commentary about the state of the PC industry going forward. And I wonder if you might share your view. And we've heard in our work a few bubbles in the Chromebook market and maybe a couple of PC OEMs saying they're building a tiny bit of CPU inventory. So on the back of that commentary about the market, if you have any views on your own visibility in inventory of AMD parts or maybe the gap between orders and your ability to fulfill them in the PC market, those things would be really helpful."

I'm just curious, did EPYC outgrow the overall segment? Or was it more in line? Can you give us a sense of how it did relative to the segment?",
        "And then my second question is just more of a strategic question around pricing. Clearly, last week, on their conference call, Intel talked about perhaps being a little bit more price aggressive, especially in data center, to protect share. And I'd like to get kind of your thought on pricing. I mean in my mind, that market is much more about a total cost of ownership than an entry point. And given your price performance, I'm just kind of curious as to how concerned you are about the pricing environment and how concerned you think we should be over time."

It's a relatively big market, right? It's about a $6 billion, $7 billion market. Milan supports much more networking functionality versus prior generations. And operators continue to virtualize the core of their networks. And with 5G, they're also starting to virtualize their radio access networks. And so just wanted to see if the team is seeing early momentum with Milan with telco equipment OEMs, as well as with some of the large 5G service providers.",

And maybe that's a function of some of the opportunities -- the other opportunities that you have. I'm just curious, given your other outlook for kind of continued strong growth, do you think that strong growth is dependent at all on the state of the PC market next year? So for example, like if PCs, say, were down 10% next year, do you still think you could still grow strongly year over year in 2022 off the rest of the portfolio?",
        "I have a follow-up if you don't mind. I want to ask the opex question a little more explicitly. So you didn't take it down for the year and you're 25%. But if I'm doing my math right, the Q4 opex percentage is closer to 28%. And I get why and I understand. But I think the Analyst Day model you've given, 16 months ago, had sort of an opex to revenue midpoint somewhere in the mid-26s. Should we think about opex, I guess, trending down from that exit rate to that more kind of like model level? Or are you still going to be taking this opportunity, at least for the next like several quarters, maybe to invest at a bit of a higher level? Is that exit rate of opex to revenue more representative of what we might see in the near to medium term?"

I thought it was fascinating because it looks like they're disabling one of the threads and running Milan in a single-threaded mode, which seems to me like a throwback to 20 years ago. So I had a couple of questions on this. I haven't seen Intel Xeon processors in this mode. Is there something about the AMD architecture or the Milan architecture beyond higher core count that just makes it more sense to use AMD processors in this mode versus Intel processors? Are you seeing a lot of demand outside of Google for this kind of single-threaded implementation? And if you are, would it make sense to make like a separate line of CPUs that streamlines the logic for only one processing thread and then you could fit -- potentially fit a lot more cores on the CPU and cut the power dissipation? It seems like it would be the next logical step. Would that even be feasible? Is that something you consider you're getting demand for?"
