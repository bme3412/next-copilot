            "topic": "YouTube Direct Response Advertising",
            "content": "We definitely have seen traction there. I think an area where it really works well, for example, is app installs. That's a great example of it. Gaming is another good example of it. And we are working on iterating and making the formats work better so that it applies to more contexts as well. But, in general, I think businesses are learning to adapt. Obviously, we've had great success with Search. And so we're bringing a lot of those learnings and we're sharing it with our customers. And so we expect to see more traction there over time."

            "topic": "Resiliency and Strength in Advertising",
            "content": "Overall, in Cloud, the interest and the momentum remains strong. We are obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite. And we find our offerings are getting deeper, and we are really helping customers from a deeper standpoint. So we see overall momentum. There are cases where even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins, things are taking a bit longer. Naturally, as you would expect, our customers are impacted through moments like this, too. So I would say time to closing some larger deals are impacted. But the companies, if anything, all the way at a CEO level are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper way. And I think that's a longer-term trend we are excited about. Obviously, consumption gets impacted, depending on the sectors which companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general underlying performance of that sector. And so that's something we'll have to wait and see how it develops. But the teams are doing well, and it's an area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply for the long run."

            "topic": "Post-Crisis Strategic Priorities",
            "content": "In terms of overall priorities, I would say we've always taken a long-term view in thinking through the arc of where things are going. And our deep focus on AI is an example of that. And we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term. And so, if anything, through moments like that, the strong foundation we've built, allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term areas. So AI is a good example of it. The shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we're going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment. And so the thesis still remains. So we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale -- is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that. Beyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging. So, for example, eCommerce is an area. And, as I mentioned, we responded through this with the changes we announced on our Shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there. And with new leaders in place, we're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there. And so we are looking at shifts, be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G Suite, and adapting and investing in those areas as well. So that's how we're approaching it."

            "topic": "YouTube Monetization and Direct Response",
            "content": "I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right, it's a platform working at scale. I think Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So looking across, I think there is more room -- significantly more room over the mid- to long-term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it."

            "topic": "Ads Revenue Growth and Seasonality",
            "content": "In terms of Ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our Ads business, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it's premature for me to comment on the trend. In terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as we said, for Search and Other Revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter. But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter, while Brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March. So by the end of March, total YouTube Ads Revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single-digits."

            "topic": "Expenses and Cost Optimization",
            "content": "Yes, we do have efficiency efforts that we started that we had going as we entered this year. But as a result of what we're seeing in the environment, our view was that we should really double down on those. And so when we go through the various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation about really optimizing headcount around the various areas. What we've determined is we're going to at this point slow the pace of hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the pace of hiring. And that's helping as we're driving a deeper look into how do you optimize within each area. The same is true, for example, in some of the comments on marketing. We are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and marketing line, the majority of it is headcount-related. And we do continue to invest here in Ads and, in particular, in Cloud. As it relates to the marketing component, namely, Ads and Promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our plans in the beginning of the year. And we continue to have a healthy budget for Ads and Promo, particularly in digital, to support many business areas. But as with the other areas of investment, we're really focused on optimizing across products and services. And with physical events cancelled for much of the year, marketing spend is also reduced. And so that's another example. With machines and servers, we've been focused on efficiency of the fleet for some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further. So we're looking at the operating environment and saying we should continue to lean into the efficiency programs we can. It does help us free up some resources for the growth areas that continue to be a priority. But it is an accentuation of where we were."

            "topic": "Share Repurchase Authorization",
            "content": "We remain focused on investing for long-term growth. The primary use of capital really is to support that growth. The second use is to support acquisitions and investments, as we've already been talking about. Given our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. We view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital."

            "topic": "Sites TAC Rate Trends",
            "content": "So in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things. We've discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content costs are included in other cost of sales. And so that's the most important thing to point to. The other, as we've previously discussed, is TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I'd really point you to the first point there."
