          "content": "Sure. Toshiya, thank you for the question. So first of all, we had a very strong quarter for the Data Center overall in Q3 and especially for the Instinct product portfolio. We actually completed some important customer milestones, and we were able to ramp a bit above our initial expectations.\n\nSo Data Center GPU was very strong in the third quarter, and we raised overall guidance for the year from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion based on the completion of some of those customer milestones. So we feel good about the trajectory as we go through the end of this year. And then to your overall question about 2025. At a high level, look, we feel very good about the market from everything that we see, talking to customers, there's significant investment in trying to build out the infrastructure required across all of the AI workloads.\n\nAnd then within that, our product portfolio is getting stronger with the annual cadence, launching 325 later this quarter and 355 in the second half of next year. And then in terms of customers, our customer engagements are actually broadening quite well. So, certainly, cloud -- our largest cloud customers are broadening the set of workloads that they're running on AMD Instinct.\n\nAnd we're also very engaged with a number of large cloud and enterprise customers that are actively working with us and optimizing their workloads, and we would expect those would be good opportunities for us over the next couple of quarters as well."

          "topic": "EPYC Server CPU Growth Expectations and Share Gains",
          "content": "Yeah, sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So, you know, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made with EPYC. I think a couple of things.\n\nFirst of all, in terms of competitive positioning and just the traction in the market, our fourth-gen EPYC between Gen 1 Bergamo is really doing very well. We've seen broad adoption across cloud. And then we've been very focused on enterprise as well as third-party cloud instances. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're starting to see very nice traction in enterprise with both new customers as well as existing customers, and then for third-party cloud adoption, also a good pickup there as well.\n\nSo, I think overall, I think our EPYC portfolio has done well. Going into the second half of the year, I think we also feel good about it. There are a couple of positives there. We see -- first of all, the market looks like it's improving, so we have seen some return to spending in both enterprise and cloud.\n\nAnd so, I think those are positive market trends. And then in addition to that, we are in the process of launching Turin. So, we started production here in the second quarter and we're on track to launch broadly in the second half of the year. We'll see some revenue of Turin in the second half of the year contributing as well.\n\nSo, overall, I think the server market and our ability to continue to grow share in the server market is one of the things that we see in the second half of the year."

          "topic": "Data Center GPU Roadmap and Rack-Scale Systems",
          "content": "Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, let me start with your original question. I mean, I think looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter, but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities.\n\nAnd 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year. And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers. I think there are people who certainly want more rack-level solutions, and we're certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products.\n\nYou'll see us invest more in system-level integration. But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 series is it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 series. And so, it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325.\n\nSo, we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the road map that we're planning."

          "topic": "AI PC Positioning and Competitive Landscape",
          "content": "Yeah. So, first, you know, we're very pleased with our client business results. I think we have a very strong road map, so I'm very pleased with the road map.\n\nThe Zen 5-based products, we're launching both notebook and desktop in this -- in the middle of this year. What we've seen is actually very positive feedback on the product. So, we just actually launched the first Strix-based notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale.\n\nYou may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive. Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let's call it, above-typical seasonality, given the strength of our product launches and when we're launching.\n\nAnd then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points, which will also open up more opportunities. So, overall, I would say the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong.\n\nAnd we're working very closely with both the ecosystem partners as well as our OEM partners to have strong launches here into the second half of the year."

          "topic": "Open Ethernet Consortium and System Integration",
          "content": "Yeah, I think it's very important to say we are very supportive of the open ecosystem. We're very supportive of the ultra Ethernet consortium. But I don't believe that that is a limiter to our ability to build large-scale systems. I think Ethernet is something that many in the industry feel will be the long-term answer for networking in these systems.\n\nAnd we have a lot of work that we're doing with internally as well as with our customers and partners to enable that."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Expectations and Drivers",
          "content": "Yes. Thank you for that question. First, we are very pleased with our Q3 gross margin performance. We delivered 53.6% and we are guiding approximately 54% in Q4.\n\nIn general, when you look at 2024, our gross margin improvement has been primarily driven by the mix, especially Data Center business continue to be the strong growth driver of our business, it's accounting for more than 50% of our revenue mix, that helps us to improve gross margin. Going to 2025, we're not going to guide specifically. But as you mentioned, there are puts and takes that will help us going forward I would say first is, going forward, the largest growth driver is our Data Center business, both the CPU side, the GPU side, and you are absolutely right, we see our Enterprise Server business continue to expand. That will be a tailwind on gross margin side.\n\nAnd secondly, Embedded business is recovering and gradually, but that will also help us with our gross margin. At the same time, we are also seeing our Client business expansion nicely. Client business today is more focused on consumer side, which tend to be below corporate average. That's something headwind we'll deal with.\n\nAnd lastly, I would say our team has done a great job to continue to improve operational efficiency. When we scale the company next year, you can see we're going to benefit from economies of scale to continue to drive our operational efficiency to improve gross margin."

And more importantly, as you look forward into calendar '25, I doubt you're going to give us quantitative guidance on this call. But conceptually, how are you thinking about growth in your Instinct between your large cloud customers and your enterprise customers? And if you can speak to the possibility of adding new customers within cloud, again, specific to Instinct, that would be really helpful."

        "Hey, thanks a lot, and congratulations on these results. Lisa, I wanted to ask you about MI300, how you see it playing out sequentially for the rest of the year. I guess there's about $2.8 billion left to hit your annual target. So, I'm wondering if you see things picking up in the fourth quarter and how that's going sequentially.\n\nAnd if you don't mind, I wanted to also ask about next year if you see potential for rapid growth. You're probably aware of some of the chatter out there, and I just was wondering if you're already seeing signs that you can grow significantly, given your road map for next year. Thank you so much."

I guess maybe building on the latter point that you just made, I'm curious of how you would characterize your supply chain having evolved now talking about $5-plus billion. How do we think about what you've been doing on the supply side, given the lead times, the production cycles of these MI300 and MI325 GPUs as we look out into 2025.\n\nAnd I have another question."

And then, Lisa, you just talked about it being up left. Just curious, I know it's kind of a muted recovery.\n\nBut what's happening in the Embedded business implied in your fourth quarter guidance? And how are you thinking about 2025 just directionally?"

On the Data Center GPU side, I realize everyone wants new customer announcements and 2025 guidance, but we're not going to get that, certainly not today.\n\nThat maybe you could speak to how much of a runway you think exists at existing customers? And how much of a catalyst MI325X on CDNA3 and then MI355 on the new architecture can be to growing revenue and workload breadth internally and externally at these existing customers as we think about growth into next year at the Data Center GPU side?"

        "I had two. So Lisa, for the first one, how do you address this investor argument that MI is off to a great start, but spec-wise, remains kind of 1 year behind the industry leader, right? You're shipping something comparable to Hopper while they are starting to ship Blackwell next year. When you are at MI350, they will be on Blackwell Ultra or Rubin. So how do you see AMD closing that gap? And can you really gain share until that gap is closed?\n\nAnd for my follow-up, Lisa, back to the question on the PC market. So it was up -- or the client was up 26% sequentially. I think you are guiding to some growth in Q4 as well. How do you see the state of the channel? And I ask that just because sell-through in Q3 was not that great.\n\nAnd I think Intel had guided down their Q3 to be flat or down. So just how much of the growth that you are seeing is because of ASPs? How much of this is units? And as you look out to 2025, do you think the ASP strength that we have seen this year, can that mix benefit continue for you in '25 also?"

        "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, on your core EPYC business, you did start to see recovery in enterprise last quarter. It was broad-based across many verticals.\n\nYou've got -- you've also got a growing share dynamic as well, right? And it sounds like that trend continued in the September quarter. Do you anticipate continued follow-through in terms of quarter-on-quarter growth this quarter for enterprise? And then maybe what sort of enterprise and general cloud demand trends are you seeing out of China?"

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. But the first one, I wanted to go back to what you said about the size of the Data Center GPUs in the quarter. You said it was approaching the size of Your compute business which you put around what under $1.7 billion, maybe a little more.\n\nIs that right? And like if that is right, it implies that at $5 billion for the year, you'd actually be down in Q4. So I'd probably got to be $5.2 billion or $5.3 billion for the full year, just to be flat sequentially and more than that to get growth. So I guess the question is number one, is that the size of the business that you're talking about in Q3? And is that the kind of level of growth you're thinking into Q4? Like how should we think about that?"

And also congratulations on $5 billion in Instinct revenues. So I wanted to ask the first question.\n\nThis is one we get from investors all the time. In the coming year, let's say, 2025, your key competitor will take most of the TAM of the AI market, the GPU market, rough count, they'll take in something like $50 billion, $60 billion, you'll get another $5 billion to $10 billion, call it. So the question is, what do you think is the major hindrance? You've got chip level compatibility. So does it boil down to the fact that you're just earlier in the game.\n\nYou've been doing this just 12 months in a serious manner? Or is there still a rack level of disparity? If you could just help us think about what the hindrances are to you becoming a major player here."

Just curious if you can kind of characterize the makeup of the customers in the first half.\n\nI know you had, end of last year, a government customer. Is there still a government contingency? And kind of the second part of it is really you've invested in all these software assets. Kind of curious the challenge of ramping the next wave of customers. I know there's been a lot of talk on some hardware challenges, memory issues, and such, but then you're investing in software.\n\nI'm sure that's a big challenge, too. Just kind of curious what the biggest hurdle is for you to kind of get that next wave of customers ramp."

Obviously, you're launching the MI325 series.\n\nShould you say -- should we expect a significant contribution the new product in Q4? Or is this a situation in which it's launching late year and most of the impact is into Q1? I guess that's the first one. And then the second one is just if you look into next year, could you talk about where the end markets are and Embedded for Xilinx? You gave some color on comm and a little of industrial there. But just where we're at in terms of starting kind of Q4 and into Q1. Are there any that are outperforming, underperforming? Any color there would be helpful."
