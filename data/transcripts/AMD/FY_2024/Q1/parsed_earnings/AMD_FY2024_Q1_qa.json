          "topic": "MI300 Revenue Incremental Growth",
          "content": "Great. Thank you, Toshiya for the question. Look, the MI300 ramp is going really well. If we look at just what's happened over the last 90 days, we've been working very closely with our customers to qualify MI300 in their production data centers, both from a hardware standpoint, software standpoint.\n\nSo far, things are going quite well, and what we see now is just greater visibility to both current customers as well as new customers committing to MI300. So that gives us the confidence to go from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And I view this as you know very much -- as a very dynamic market, and there are lots of customers. We said on the -- in the prepared remarks that we have over 100 customers that were engaged with in both development as well as deployment.\n\nSo overall the ramp is going really well. As it relates to the supply chain, actually I would say I'm very pleased with how supply has ramped. It is absolutely the fastest product ramp that we have done. It's a very complex product.\n\nChiplets, CoWos, 3D integration, HBM. And so far it's gone extremely well. We've gotten great support from our partners. And I would say even in the quarter that we just finished, we actually did a little bit better than expected when we first started the quarter.\n\nI think Q2 will be another significant ramp, and we're going to ramp supply every quarter this year. So I think the supply chain is going well. We are tight on supply. So there's no question in the near term that if we had more supply we have demand uh for that product.\n\nAnd we're going to continue to work on those elements as we go through the year. But I think both on the demand side and the supply side, I'm very pleased with how the ramp is going."

          "topic": "Data Center GPU Roadmap Beyond MI300",
          "content": "Yeah, sure. So look, Toshiya, when we start with the roadmap, I mean we always think about it as a multi-year, multi-generational roadmap. So we have the follow-ons to MI300 as well as the next next generations well in development. I think what is true is we're getting much closer to our top AI customers.\n\nThey're actually giving us significant feedback on the roadmap and what we need to meet their needs. Our chiplet architecture is actually very flexible, and so that allows us to actually make changes to the roadmap as necessary. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to be very competitive. Frankly, I think we're going to get more competitive.\n\nRight now, I think MI300X is in a sweet spot for inference, very, very strong inference performance. I see as we bring in additional products later this year into 2025, that will continue to be a strong spot for us, and then we're also enhancing our training performance and our software roadmap to go along with it. So more details to come in the coming months. But we have a strong roadmap that goes through the next couple of years, and it is informed by just a lot of learning in working with our top customers."

          "topic": "Competitive Environment and EPYC Leadership",
          "content": "Yeah, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the -- our EPYC business has actually performed pretty well. The market is a bit mixed.\n\nI think some of the cloud guys are still working through sort of their optimizations. I think it's different by customer. We did see here in the first quarter actually some very nice early signs in the enterprise space, sort of large customers starting refresh programs. The value proposition of Genoa is very, very strong, and we're seeing that pull through across the enterprise.\n\nIn the second quarter, we expect overall data center to be up strong double digits. And then within that, we expect server to be up as well. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think there are a couple of drivers for us. We do expect some improvement in the overall market conditions for the server business, but we also have our Turin launch in the second half of the year.\n\nThat will also, we believe, extend our leadership position within the server market. So overall, I think the business is performing well, and we believe that we're continuing to be very well positioned to gain share throughout the year."

          "topic": "AI PC Opportunities and ASP Growth",
          "content": "Yeah, so I think, again I think we're pretty excited about the AI PC, both opportunity in, let's call it, the near term and even more so in the medium term. I think the client business is performing well, both on the channel and on the M&C side. We expect client to be up sequentially in the second quarter. And as we go into the second half of the year, to your question about units versus ASPs, I think we expect some increase in units as well as ASPs.\n\nThe AI PC products, when we look at the Strix products, it's -- they're really well suited for the premium segments of the market. And I think that's where you're going to see some of the AI PC content strongest in the beginning. And then as we go into 2025, you would see it more across the rest of the portfolio."

But I don't believe that that is a limiter to our ability to build large-scale systems. I think Ethernet is something that many in the industry feel will be the long-term answer for networking in these systems.\n\nAnd we have a lot of work that we're doing with internally as well as with our customers and partners to enable that."

That's consistent with past. On the Embedded side, it's very consistent with what we said in the past and the consistent with what you see in the industry's Embedded business is going through a bottoming process, and we think Q1, it will have a low-double-digit sequential decline.\n\nThat's Embedded. On the Gaming side, Lisa mentioned during his -- her prepared remarks is we have the latest stage of product cycle in the year five of gaming console. But at the same time, we also have inventory at the customers. So, the combination of those impact, we expect the Q1 Gaming sequential declines probably more than 30%, so hopefully that help you a little bit."

I think the team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the data center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities.\n\nI think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top-line revenue growth much faster than opex growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Expectations and Drivers",
          "content": "Yeah. I think the embedded business declined a little bit more than expected really due to the weaker demand in some of the markets. Very specifically, communication has been weak.\n\nAnd some pockets of industrial and automotive, as you mentioned, it's actually quite consistent with the peers. Second half, we do think the first half is the bottom of embedded business, and we'll start to see gradual recovery in the second half. And going back to your gross margin question is when you look at our gross margin expansion in both Q1 and guided Q2, the primary driver is the strong performance on the data center side. The data center will continue to ramp in second half.\n\nI think that will continue to be the major driver of gross margin expansion in second half. Of course, if embedded is doing better, we'll have a more tailwind in second half."

I'm curious, what's driving that incremental $500 million in revenue? Is it new customers? Is it additional bookings from existing customers? Is it more cloud? Is it more enterprise? If you can sort of provide color there that would be helpful.\n\nAnd then on the supply side, there's been headlines or chatter that CoWos under HBM could be a pretty severe constraining factor for you guys. If you can speak to how you're handling the supply side of the equation, that would be helpful, too. And then I have a quick follow-up."

The non AI side of the data center business, it sounds like the enterprise side has some good traction even though the sequential drop happened seasonally, Lisa. But I was just wondering, what's implied in your second-quarter guidance for the data center CPU side of things? And generally speaking, how are you seeing that whole kind of GPU versus CPU crowding out dynamic playing out for the rest of 2024?"

Lisa, I have sort of a longer-term question and then a shorter-term follow-up.\n\nOne, I guess is the -- one of the questions that I've been getting from folks a lot is, obviously your primary competitor has announced, I guess, a multiyear roadmap. And we continue to hear more and more from other folks about internal ASIC programs at some of your primary customers, whether they be for inference, or training, or both. I guess it would be really helpful if you could to talk to us about how your conversations go with those customers, how committed they are to your long-term roadmap, multi-generation, as you described it, how they juxtapose doing investments of their internal silicon versus using a merchant supplier like yourselves and maybe what advantages the experience across a large footprint of customers can give your company that those guys doing internal ASICs might not get. Thanks."

I know you said a couple of quarters ago that it would eventually be above corporate average, but it would take you a few quarters to get there.\n\nCan you talk about where you are in that?\n\nAnd then a separate follow-up on the Turin transition on server. I know when you had transitioned into Genoa, you said it could take a little while that there were significant platform shifts and things like that. Turin seems to be much more kind of ecosystem-compatible.\n\nHow quickly do you think you might see that product ramp within your server portfolio?"

On your data center GPU segment and the faster time to production shipments, given you just upped your full-year GPU outlook, how much of it is faster bring up of your customers frameworks driven by your latest ROCm software platform and maybe stronger collaboration with your customers engineers just to get them to call faster? And how much of it is just a more aggressive build-out plan by customers versus their prior expectations given what appears to be pretty strong urgency for them to move forward with their important AI initiatives?"

        "Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the competitive environment. Obviously on the CPU side, you had a competitor talk about launching a high core count product in the coming quarter, kind of ramping now and more so into Q3. You've seen really good pricing tailwinds as a function of the higher core capital.\n\nCan you talk about what you're seeing in that market? Do you think that there's any risk for more aggressive pricing, which would impact your ASP ramp for the rest of the year?\n\nHelpful. And then a broader question to follow up here. So I think it got asked earlier about the importance of systems. But on your end, how important is the Open Ethernet consortium to you being able to move more into systems? I know that today you obviously have some internal assets and then you can partner with others.\n\nBut is there a way that you can be competitive before there is an industry standard on the Ethernet side? And can you talk about when you think the timing of that kind of consortium comes to market and enables you to maybe accelerate that roadmap? Thanks a lot."

So we recently hosted a very large custom GPU company for a call, and they talked about kind of mega data centers coming up in the near to mid-term, talking about nodes potentially in the 100,000-plus range and maybe up to a million.\n\nSo as we look out at these kinds of data centers, from an architectural standpoint, is that a situation where winner takes all where if somebody gets in, they kind of get all the sockets? Or will they be lines where your chip perhaps or your board can be placed right next to somebody else's board maybe on a separate line? Just help us understand how something like that would play out if there's a chance for more than one competitor to play in such a large data center."

        "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I wanted to address the MI300 ramp into Q2. So you said you've done $1 billion give or take in cumulative sales, which puts it at maybe, I don't know, maybe $600 million in Q1.\n\nYou're guiding total revenues up about $225 million into Q2. But you've got client up. You've got traditional data center up. You've got embedded flat.\n\nGaming is going to be down, but I'd hazard a guess that the client and traditional data are all up. If not, does the MI300 ramp into Q2, is it more or less than the total corporate ramp that you've got built into guidance right now? Is it that you're expecting?\n\nAnd then for my follow-up I wanted to ask Matt's question a little more directly, you didn't quite answer it. That the $400 billion number that you've got out there, is that just silicon in chips or is there hardware and servers and stuff like that in that number as well, like what's in that number?"

It was rumored NVIDIA might be doing that as well. Would love your expectations for this market.\n\nAnd what does that mean for the TAM for AMD moving forward?\n\nAnd then, can you talk about where we stand in Data Center FPGA and that outlook, FPGA for AI?

So, I'm sure you're intimately familiar with TSMC's manufacturing roadmap and we've all seen the Intel open up the kimono on what they expect to happen over the next couple of years. I mean, do you think Intel is going to close the gap somewhat with what you've found here over the next couple of years? Do you think they'll be able to maintain the lead?"
