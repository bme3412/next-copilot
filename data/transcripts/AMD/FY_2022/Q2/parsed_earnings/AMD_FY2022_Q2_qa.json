          "content": "So in terms of the Q3 and the Q4 guidance, so if we would start first with Q3, I think the Q3 guidance implies that, first of all, the revenue growth is led by the data center, as well as some increase in our Semi-Custom or game console business, which historically peaks in the third quarter. We have taken a more conservative outlook on the PC business. So a quarter ago, we would have thought that the PC business would be down, let's call it, high single digits. And our current view of the PC business is that it will be down, let's call it, mid-teens. And that's contemplated into our third-quarter guidance. And then as we go into the fourth quarter, what we see is, again, the sequential growth there will be led by the data center, as well as our embedded business, with the same view of the PC business. But what we also have there is a set of new product ramps that we're very excited about. So we have a number of 5-nanometer products that will be ramping in the fourth quarter, including our client products, as well as our server -- our general products, as well as our graphics products. So that's sort of the view of Q3 and Q4 from a revenue standpoint. And then from a margin standpoint, again, we're guiding full-year margin at 54%, which is what we -- which is the same. And again, it's a mix of business in each of the businesses that is resulting in that."

          "topic": "Data Center Business and Market Correlation",
          "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question on the data centers. So look, the data center business has grown very nicely for us. We're pleased with the segment growth both on a year over year as well as a sequential basis. In terms of what we're seeing underneath that, in the second quarter, for example, we did see the cloud business continue to be very strong. So from what we -- from our customers, we're continuing to ramp new cloud instances and workloads with Milan and we see that continuing into the second half of the year. For the enterprise business, we actually did make also a good progress on the OEM side there as well. What I would say is the trends there are a bit more mixed and perhaps more correlated to some of the macro backdrop. So we do see a significant pipeline, although some of the deals are taking a little bit longer to close. And I would say that there are some match set of things that the OEMs are working through. But all in all, I think we continue to see significant growth opportunities as we go into the second half of the year and into 2023 just given our strong product positioning. And as I said, in this part of the cycle, we see Milan continuing to ramp into the second half of the year. And then we see Genoa coming in toward the end of the year into 2023. So I do think, to your overall question, do we become more correlated to the market? I mean, we are -- we've certainly gained a lot of share. So we're a larger piece of the market, but we are still underrepresented. And the visibility with our customers, especially our large cloud customers second half of this year into next year is very good. And we're planning really for the next 4 to 6 quarters, and that gives us good visibility."

          "topic": "Inventory Levels and Market Impact",
          "content": "Yes. No. I wouldn't say that, Tim. What I would say is that, again, whenever we put together full-year guidance especially from the beginning of the year, we understand that not everything is going to be exactly so. So as we look now into the second half of the year, what we're seeing is, again, data center is strong. Again, we expect data center to grow second half to first half nicely. Embedded/Xilinx will also grow to some extent, second half to first half. And the consoles will also grow as well. And so I think as we look at those components offsetting what is perhaps a more conservative PC outlook, we believe that, that offsets nicely. And again, just as a reminder, we do have a number of product ramps in the fourth quarter that are coming out in 5-nanometer, we think that will drive sort of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter. So I think those are some of the puts and takes in the full-year guide."

          "topic": "Free Cash Flow and Working Capital",
          "content": "I think, one, is when the revenue grows a lot, there's investment leader in working capital. So working capital numbers from an inventory and AR standpoint, they're up significantly year on year. We also have, as we said previously, a 3% tax rate going up to about 10%. And the cash taxes get paid. But the timing of the cash taxes sometimes is Q2. And in Q2, we did have some significant cash tax payment from a payment standpoint given the timing of payments of the federal government. And then you have timing of shipments that does affect the free cash flow. And the last thing I'll mention given the discussion, some of the questions that Lisa was asked about, supply for server and supply overall with the share gain of the growth of the business. We are making investments in capacity from a prepayment standpoint, and those obviously require funding the suppliers, and that also has an impact on the free cash flow because that flows through the free cash flow accretion. So this is really, if you look at it, inventory and capacity investing for growth and investing for the future."

          "topic": "Purchase Commitments",
          "content": "I think in 2021, as I said on the Financial Day, we had about $1 billion committed and paid. And this year, it does step up a little bit, especially given all the supply that we need to get ready for 2023. And that does flow to the free cash flow. In the first half, it wasn't so significant, but it does step up in the second half. So it will impact that from that standpoint."

        "Lisa, I just wanted to revisit the second half outlook because your large competitor recently presented a very bleak picture of PC and enterprise and data center talking about excess inventory, etc., but you are leaving your expectations relatively unchanged. I'm curious, how do you see your inventory levels? And do you think AMD could be impacted by any excess PC or server or graphics inventory from your main competitors? Just is your second half you think adequately derisked the way you see it today?",
        "Got it. And for my follow-up, Lisa, one more on the data center side. So cloud spending seems very strong right now. But we see all these media reports about the cloud players wanting to control their spending levels, etc. When do you think that shows up in their spending outlook? Or do you think you have enough of a share gain story with Genoa coming out later this year to offset any slowdown from just a broader spending environment perspective? And just how are you feeling about the next-gen kind of Genoa versus Sapphire Rapids competitive outlook?"

        "For my first question, your larger competitor now has a very sort of publicly admitted push-out on their own server product. Does that make you feel like better for what you see for your Genoa ramp, especially as we get into 2023? Is it stronger than you may have seen it previously? And I guess if that's the case, it sounds like you were still a little bit supply constrained on server in general in Q2. Do you have the supply as we go into next year to upside on that number if the orders actually do get stronger in the wake of the Sapphire Rapids delay?",
        "Got it. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the implied Q4 outlook. Again, I know you answered some questions on some of the drivers into Q4. But if I look at it, it's taken at the dead midpoint, it's something like a 7% sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 with gross margins going up about 100 bps to 55%. I guess, of that increase, is it fair to say that the bulk of it continues to be data center and may be embedded? The gross margins to me would suggest that that's probably the case. But any more further color you could give us on the magnitude of what's driving that increase would be helpful."

        "Congrats on the solid results, especially in this environment. And, Laura, congratulations on your retirement. Lisa, I want to dig a little bit into the Gaming business. You obviously have the two parts of that: the client GPUs and the game console side of things. It seems like there are very different dynamics happening there. So when you talked about the -- I believe you said the client GPU side would be down year over year in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's happening there? Is that just a reflection of the PC market? Or is there any sort of share gains, product issues going on? And then the Semi-Custom color, you sounded like it's going to remain strong for the rest of the year. So is there -- is that just the fourth year of the ramp or the third year, I guess, it would be -- or is there some sort of seasonal effect we should appreciate as well?",
        "I guess, for my follow-up, switching over to the gross margin side of things. You guys have done an amazing job on that, and Xilinx obviously helps raise the bar as well. As we look forward, I know you have a long-term target of 57%, can you just talk about if supply becomes looser? And I know you have areas that are loosening and areas that are tight simultaneously. But can you talk about the cost inflation you're feeling? Do you think that will lessen at all next year? And kind of how do we think about the March from the 55 you seem to be exiting this year at to the 57. What's the sort of timetable and the drivers of that increase?"

        "Thank you very much, and thanks, Laura, for the partnership down the years. Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the server business. Obviously, the growth is very strong right now. But a lot of that business continues to be driven by the engagements that you've had and continue to build out with cloud. As we look forward over the next, I mean you had talked in some of your script about how you guys were preparing for continued growth in the Server business over the next four, six, eight quarters. And the road map is going to diversify some next year with Bergamo and Ciena and Genoa seeming to launch on top of the Genoa platform. And I wonder if you give some color on how the relationships and engagements are going in enterprise and in the telco wireless space as well? I'm just trying to get a gauge of how quickly the server business can grow through diversification, not just continued share gains with cloud.",
        "As my follow-up, it's a question I would normally ask Devinder, but I've gotten a few emails on it in the last hour. So I figure I'd go ahead and ask it. The revenue, obviously, including Xilinx, up 70% or so year on year, but A few people have pointed out to me that the cash flow or the free cash flow was only up a tiny bit or very, very modestly. And I wonder if you could walk us through that a little bit where the one-time items with inventory step-up with acquisitions, where maybe more investments in supply."

I apologize to kind of continue to go there. But as I look at the trends over the last couple of quarters, and especially given the unit decline that we saw at your largest competitor in this last quarter, I'm curious if you could help us appreciate the trajectory of what you're seeing from a blended overall pricing perspective within your server CPU business. Just trying to appreciate as we get into Genoa or Bergamo as we move into 2023. How should we think about the ASP trend on a blended basis within the server CPUs?",
        "Yes. Yes. And then just as a quick follow-up, I'm curious on the data center GPU business. You talked about Frontier, I'm curious about where you guys expect that business to kind of shape out for the year? Have you started to see further traction in the ability to sell your CPU plus GPU strategy more broadly?"

        "Great. And then as a follow-up on -- just wondering how you think about competition in microprocessors in the context of -- for the last four years, either you or Intel has generally been constrained, Intel for a couple of years than you for the last couple of years. As those constraints ease and obviously, Intel utilization probably falls a little bit here. Could you talk about what you anticipate pricing wise? Do you think anything changes? Or does this continue to be kind of a value-priced market?"

        "I wanted to come back to the data center business. If I look at the spreadsheet that Saresh sent around with the restated data center numbers. And it looks like your data center business kind of aligns apples-to-apples to Intel's pretty closely. It looks like you guys gained 6.6% share from Intel. And if I kind of take a guess about the pro forma contribution of Xilinx, what it would have been in Q1, it's about 6% share gain. And that would be -- I think that would be the highest share gain in that data center business that you guys ever reported even going back to 2005. Admittedly, two-thirds of that is from Intel declining. I guess since that would put you against until, I guess, in the like kind of the mid-20s, and I'm curious if you think that math sounds about right to you. And I'm hoping that you could because we're grouping more things together, if you could just share with us, was there any outsized contribution from Xilinx or Pensando or something like that and that, that would make that look -- that might change the interpretation from what it looks like on the service because that's a pretty big jump in share? So that's the first part of the question. I had a follow-up, too.",
        "OK. Great. And then the follow-up, if I may. I just wanted to come back to the visibility on this business. And I'm wondering like about the kind of like the variance that you get from your cloud customers. So I guess, the scenario that I'm curious about is, I imagine the cloud, a lot of the cloud companies do a lot of planning on their data center since it is central to their business. And they sign a data center lease that's going to get built in six months. Do they -- after they do that, do they come to you guys and say, hey, this is coming online. We need to get these chips from you in six months and how consistent and how tight is the variance span around the visibility that they give you guys? And that's all I had."

Your cloud customers obviously are anxiously awaiting these platforms. Would you be rolling out your high-volume cloud SKUs first? And what's the qualification look like on these high-volume SKUs? Just asking because, obviously, your competitor is struggling with SKU releases, and I just want to make sure that the AMD team is executing and releasing its high-volume SKUs to your cloud customers."

It seems like maybe if you take the lost units and you multiply by ASP, it seems like it costs you maybe $750 million, but you kept the full year. And data center seem pretty in line. So is really the offset that you're getting better supply at Xilinx? Is that really the story? And then I have a follow-up.",
        "Awesome. And then I guess last thing, Devinder, can you talk about purchase commitments? There was a question on free cash flow, and I'm wondering if maybe there's a pretty big increase in purchase commitments. So I wonder if you can talk about that."
