        "ceo_statement": "“We delivered our eighth straight quarter of record revenue based on our strong execution and expanded product portfolio,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Each of our segments grew significantly year-over-year, led by higher sales of our data center and embedded products. We see continued growth in the back half of the year highlighted by our next generation 5nm product shipments and supported by our diversified business model.”",
        "cfo_statement": "“We had an excellent second quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth across all segments, margin expansions, and record profitability,” said Devinder Kumar, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue was $6.6 billion, up 70% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue across all segments and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue. Gross margin was 54%, up 640 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by higher data center and embedded revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, compared to $909 million a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to record $2.2 billion, driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin.\n\nOperating margin was 30%, up from 24% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.7 billion, up $929 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $1.05 per share, compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.\n\nNow turning to our reportable segments.\n\nAs previously communicated, we modified our segment reporting to align with our strategic end markets and the way we now manage the business. The data center segment includes service CPUs, data center GPUs, Pensando, and Xilinx data center products. The Client segment includes desktop and notebook PC processors and chipsets, while the Gaming segment includes discrete graphic processors and Semi-Custom game console products. The Embedded segment includes both AMD and Xilinx embedded products.\n\nStarting with the data center segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 83% year over year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. Data center operating income was $472 million or 32% of revenue, compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\nClient segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year over year, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Client operating income was $676 million or 32% of revenue, compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\nGaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year over year, driven by higher Semi-Custom product sales.\n\nGaming operating income was $187 million or 11% of revenue compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by higher Semi-Custom revenue, which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses.\n\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, driven primarily by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue.\n\nEmbedded operating income was $641 million or 51% of revenue, compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago, driven by higher revenue.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $6 billion at the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we deployed $920 million to repurchase common stock and have $7.4 billion in remaining authorization.\n\nCash from operations was a record $1 billion. Quarterly free cash flow was $906 million, compared to $888 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nInventory was $2.6 billion, up approximately $220 million from the prior quarter in support of second-half revenue and the inclusion of Pensando. During the quarter, we established AMD in the investment-grade debt market by issuing debt of $1 billion.\n\nTurning to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macroeconomic environment and customer demand signals. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 55% year-over-year, primarily led by growth in the data center and embedded segments. In addition, for Q3 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.64 billion or 24.5% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.\n\nFor the full year, we continue to expect revenue of approximately $26.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 60% at the midpoint led by growth in data center and embedded segments. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. In closing, we had an excellent second quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth across all segments, margin expansions, and record profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our product and financial objectives, while continuing to monitor market signals and work closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions.\n\nWe are confident that we are well positioned for long-term growth, driven by our revenue diversification, financial model, and earnings power."
