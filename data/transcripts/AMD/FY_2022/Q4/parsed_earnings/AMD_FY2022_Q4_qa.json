          "content": "Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the data center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa fourth gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well. When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map. And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so, we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with data center. Also, on the embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so, we think that's also a grower for AMD. On the other side, our client and gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory, and I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM. And then on the gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so, console demand has been actually quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the data center and the embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the client and gaming and see how that plays out."

          "topic": "Competitive Intensity and Pricing Environment",
          "content": "Sure. So maybe let me separate data center and client because they're a little bit different. I think on the data center side, we would -- we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most important piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of fourth gen EPYC and sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers. I think on the Client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing, our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so, there are more incentives and more -- a more aggressive pricing environment. I view that that's primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes. And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see -- expect that to normalize too as everyone is sort of optimizing their capex spending."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Impact",
          "content": "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Stacy, this is Jean. Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our embedded and data center segment have strong gross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half. We continue to have the growth of both embedded and data center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impact the gross margin in the client segment. So going into second half, the normalization of the client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good. Once we normalize the client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand."

          "question": "Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. First of all, congratulations, Jean. And congrats as well to Devinder. I mean, the last five years of the company have been remarkable, but I remember all the work you and your finance team did six or seven years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement. My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023. You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the data center space and obviously, what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year."
        },
        {
          "question": "I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about gross margin. The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, three or four points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from embedded and data center. So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue? How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering?"

          "question": "Thanks for taking my question. Thanks and best wishes to Devinder and Jean from my side as well. On the first one, Lisa, I think you mentioned some elevated inventory among your cloud customers. I was hoping you could give us some quantification of how elevated? Is it a one-quarter issue? Is it a two-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your Genoa ramp? Because I think coming into this year, the expectations where you could grow server sales by over 20%. Do you think that is still a possibility because I imagine you get some benefit from better general pricing. So just puts and takes of how we should think about your data center business through this year?"
        },
        {
          "question": "And then, on the PC side and also kind of as it relates to the pricing environment, you mentioned the PC TAM is -- could be down about 10%. But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year on year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one? Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering? And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers?"

But presumably, client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are undershipping, it sounds like by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the four businesses of the second half versus the first half? Do you think your data center plus embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first half? Or I mean, could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients?"

And when it comes to AI, you do have a strategy, but you really haven't shown the product set, if you will. You talked about how you have CPU, GPU, FPGA and Pensando, and you're shipping samples of MI300, I guess, later this quarter and potentially launching in the second half. At what point do we, as analysts and investors, start to see your AI strategy materialize in the P&L and your profitability, if you will."

          "question": "And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the client business return to first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps -- you were over-earning in that business given the environment?"

I think your competitor also growing a solid pace. How do you think about the sustainability or durability of that demand in that embedded or Xilinx business as we move through '23?"

Lisa, I was hoping you could give a little bit of sequential color to just size the magnitude of the three segments that are going down in the first quarter and then embedded going up. And really what I'm getting at there is, in an answer to a prior question, you talked about the mix being a headwind to gross margin. And I think, Jean, you cited data center dropping as a percent of the mix. So just trying to get the magnitude of just how much data center has to drop to make that outcome on the mix side be true."

And Lisa, correct me if I am wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client but just to grow into second quarter.
