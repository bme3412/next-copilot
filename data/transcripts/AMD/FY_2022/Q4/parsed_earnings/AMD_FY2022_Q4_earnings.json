      "ceo_statement": "2022 was a strong year for AMD as we delivered best-in-class growth and record revenue despite the weak PC environment in the second half of the year. We accelerated our data center momentum and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model. Although the demand environment is mixed, we are confident in our ability to gain market share in 2023 and deliver long-term growth based on our differentiated product portfolio.",
      "cfo_statement": "“2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we generated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying our business portfolio.\n\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue of $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the embedded and data center segments, partially offset by lower client and gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by a richer product mix with higher revenue in the embedded and data center segments, partially offset by lower client segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx operating expenses and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth. Operating income declined to $1.3 billion, down from $1.2 billion a year ago, resulting in an operating margin of 23%, compared to 25% in the prior year.\n\nNet income was $21 million, down from $974 million a year ago, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition, partially offset by a $154 million tax benefit in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion, flat year over year.\n\n[Detailed segment analysis as provided in the summary.]"
