          "content": "Yes, absolutely, Matt. We did have a very strong first quarter. There is a lot going on, without a doubt, in the business. I would say, if you look at the strength in our business in the first quarter, it was really broad-based. So very, very strong Server results. We continue to gain share. We continue to bring more supply online there. Also, very strong results in our Semi-Custom or game console business, as well as in the Client and Graphics businesses. There is some softness in the PC market. But we had, for the last number of quarters, actually been shifting our mix to the higher end or the more premium segments of the PC market, and so that's where more of our exposure is. And we actually saw significant growth in our PC business sequentially as we started ramping our Ryzen 6000 notebooks. And that resulted in strong ASP growth, as well as just our key market segments of premium, commercial and gaming being covered there. As we go forward, obviously, all of the things that you talked about are in play. That being the case, I think we've managed through the supply situations very well. We continue to work with our customers and ensure that we're optimizing our builds to their builds. And with the addition of Xilinx, we also have another set of end markets that have very strong demand that are all additive to our business."

          "topic": "Full Year Guidance and Growth Drivers",
          "content": "Yes. So lots of questions in there, Matt, so let me try to go through them. So first on the full year 2022 guide, it is a significant increase in guidance, up 60%. There are a couple of pieces to that. On the organic side of the AMD business, we originally guided up 31% based on what we saw in the market in January. As we look at the market now and our own sort of customer and supply situation, we see that organic growth higher, into the mid-30s. That's primarily driven by very strong demand in our Server business, very strong demand in our Console or Semi-Custom business, additional supply coming online. We have taken a bit more of a conservative perspective on the PC market. Again, I think the softness is in certain parts of the market. It's not in all parts of the market. And our focus is on where we add the most value in the market and that is in the premium segments. In terms of the Xilinx piece of it, the full year addition, 3.5 quarters of Xilinx is a significant add. On a pro forma basis, the Xilinx business is also growing very well, and it's growing sort of like in the low 20s, if you consider full year compared to calendar year 2021. So overall, I think we have a lot -- a broad-based set of growth drivers and multiple levers for growth as we go through the year. And we continue to work on working with our customers on where the demand is and ensuring that we're satisfying that demand."

          "topic": "Supply Chain Management and COVID Impact",
          "content": "Yes, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So on the supply environment, we've been working on this really for the last 18 months. We've made a lot of progress on both the wafer side and significant investments on the substrates. I would say that we continue to get sort of very good support from our suppliers. That's one of the reasons we can increase our guidance the way it is. From an overall -- you mentioned the China COVID situation. From our standpoint, we haven't had any significant impact on our own shipments in our own supply chain. We have been working with some customers that have had some customer build delays and that is contemplated in our second quarter guidance. We're going to continue to work on supply optimization with the addition of Xilinx, some of the, let's call it, more mature nodes. 16-nanometer and above wafer supply is still somewhat constrained. We're working with sort of the larger scale of AMD to try to bring more supply on board there, as well as continuing to ramp our overall capacity to support a very strong sort of next few quarters. Hopefully, that answered your supply questions."

        {
          "topic": "Data Center Business and FPGA Integration",
          "content": "Right, OK. So again, a few pieces to that. Let me try to give you some color and then maybe Victor will add on the FPGA side. So in terms of -- yes, we are going to change our segment reporting, as Devinder said, as of the second quarter to be -- to give you -- to more alignment to the markets. In terms of this quarter for the pieces that you mentioned, on higher revenue, the data center for those pieces was, let's call it, low 20s percentage of our overall revenue. And then, in terms of the longer-term data center picture, we are incredibly excited opportunity in data center. When you look at the pieces we have now, I mean, the CPU franchise is very strong, continuing to get stronger. We're excited with how Genoa looks and how Bergamo looks and sort of the engagements with customers there. We're excited about the GPU portfolio as well. GPUs for us are a longer-term sort of road map, similar to what we did on the CPU side. We had been more focused on, let's call it, supercomputing and HPC, so that was strong for us last year and that's why we're flattish year on year. We're very engaged on the AI front now, continuing our investments in our software stack and working with cloud guys to optimize our software stack. And then, moving on to FPGAs and then also our adaptive SoCs and then the Pensando acquisition. I think what we now have is just an incredibly strong portfolio when we're dealing with whether you're talking about the largest cloud hyperscalers or you're talking about enterprise. And then with Pensando and Xilinx, it also gives us exposure to the edge as well. And so, between -- we have all the compute engines and are able to optimize that. So I think you should expect to hear a lot more from us in the data center, certainly is -- at our financial analyst day but really strong opportunities there."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Client Computing and Graphics Segment",
          "content": "Yeah. So, you know, our focus in this segment is to be very closely aligned with our customers and what they're doing in the market. So we've been monitoring, you know, sell-in and sell-out and sell-through trends very carefully. I think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was very much a result of, you know, sort of the product strength. And we saw, you know, very nice notebook demand continuing at the premium part of the market in commercial, gaming, premium ultrathin. So we believe that the PC performance was, you know, a bit above our original guidance, but we believe that was to match end-user demand. Going into 2022, you know, same story. I think the -- you know, what we see is 2021 was a strong year for PCs. Overall, the industry shipped, you know, approximately 350 million units. I think our view is that 2022 will be roughly flattish from a unit standpoint. But we will see a -- some mix, you know, changes in there with enterprise and premium being stronger than, for example, low end and education. So, you know, from our standpoint, it's revenue share that we believe we can gain. It's the strength of our Ryzen 6000 series that we just launched at CES. We have, you know, 200 platforms from all of the OEM customers, and we have pretty good visibility in working with our customers on that. So -- and I think we feel good about it. You know -- and, again, the client business is one of all of our businesses, you know, will grow. And I like that diversity, frankly, in the portfolio. But we feel good about the progress we've made in PCs, and we'll continue to ensure that we're matching sell-in with sell-out so that there is not inventory build in the business."

          "topic": "Semi-Custom Business Growth",
          "content": "Yes. Sure, Tim. So without going into the exact numbers, I would say the Semi-Custom business is a strong growth driver. We have -- we work with these customers very closely. We have good views of where they think the demand is. We're still in a place, if you were to look into the retail channel, you would say that the demand is underserved today in the Semi-Custom business. And their real build is toward holidays. So the answer is we do believe that Semi-Custom will be at a record for us this year. We have more content. We also have the Valve Steam Deck that also has gotten very strong reviews and is ramping as we go into the second half of the year. And then on 2023, I do believe that 2023 will be another strong year for Semi-Custom and would be up. And again, if you look at the history of these ramps, it's really around the fourth year that you see -- that you really see the business kind of hit its peak. In addition to that, just knowing some of the game releases that are -- from a software standpoint, that are coming out, there are a lot of -- there's -- there's a good line of [Inaudible] there's also an expected strong lineup as we go forward. So yes, that's our current view of the Semi-Custom business."

          "topic": "Software Strategy and Monetization",
          "content": "Yes, Brett, we have -- maybe it's a broader conversation about our overall software strategy. But as Victor mentioned, the unified software capabilities around AI are very, very important. We also have, with the acquisition of Pensando, they have a very strong software team and effort around their DPUs and what we can do there. So I think as a total, you should see us investing a lot more in software. And then in terms of the monetization and stuff, I think we can address that more as we think about the overall solution space that we'll be offering across all of these compute engines. And again, much more -- a great conversation that we can have as we come into our financial analyst day in June."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Progress and Guidance",
          "content": "I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'll say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observed, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47% to 48%. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the strength of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there. The product mix is important. The ramp in the data center and the client PC business as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So I feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Gross Margin Composition and Target",
          "content": "So the only thing I'll add, Ross, I think as you know, the situation is pretty tight, as we talked about the overall global supply situation in semiconductors. So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that."

          "topic": "Opex Guidance and Investment",
          "content": "Yeah. I think, fundamentally, and what you observe is right, very disciplined from an opex standpoint, investing in the growth is important. Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an opex standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company. And I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in opex will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, opex flattish or even down. I mean you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top priority for us."

          "topic": "FPGA and Embedded Solutions",
          "content": "Yes. I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is just, again, I think not only do we have a really broad portfolio of all the compute engines but we're doubling down on the networking side, right? Since we had strength in that in SmartNIC and then with Pensando, the kind of solutions that we could provide to customers in the overall infrastructure, right? It's not about point things, it's about the total solution. And as you probably know, scale out and just a lot of these applications, you could be thrall by the network so we really can optimize all of it. And the customers really want optimized, customized solutions. And I think that's what we could do with both the former Xilinx SmartNIC, as well as Pensando even going further."

        {
          "topic": "AI and Inference at the Edge",

I mean, look, we've been -- we have this AI engine that is already deployed in production in a number of embedded applications and endpoints and also edge devices like in cars, that are doing a lot of image recognition, all kinds of inference applications, and that same architecture can be scaled and brought into the CPU product portfolio. And as we've alluded to, that is exactly our plan. We're also -- a moment ago, as a discussion about software, we're absolutely working on the unified overall software to enable the broad portfolio but also especially in AI. So you'll hear more about that at the financial analyst day, but we're definitely going to be leaning in, in AI both inference and training, and I would say, end-to-end because we have endpoints, we have edge devices, both computing and embedded devices and in the cloud and enterprise. So we're very excited about that revenue synergy opportunity actually."

      "questions": [
        "I mean, in the first half of the year, I think you're doing, I don't know, 54%, 55% organic growth in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk me through a bit the puts and takes in the quarter. I think there's a perception that you have additional supply coming online. There's obviously supply constraints and lockdowns in China. Your Server business doing extraordinarily well in the numbers that you just printed and then maybe some perception of a softening in the PC market. So there's a lot going on, and I'd kind of love you to walk me through the puts and takes of the quarter, if you could.",
        "I guess in the press release, you guys mentioned that you expect some upside from the original 31% organic growth guidance. If you have any comments on magnitude there, that would be helpful. And then, I think just what investors would love to hear from you is maybe your view on the data center capex spending environment and also on the PC market. I think you guys had been maybe a bit more conservative than some of your competition in your market commentary about PCs maybe being flattish coming into this year. I imagine there's some new puts and takes to that. So just some thoughts on how you guys constructed the guidance for the year, especially relative to the original 31% would be really helpful."

And I guess, more importantly, how are you thinking about the medium- to long-term opportunity in both your classic data center GPU business, as well as the FPGA business. I think in data center GPU, you mentioned that it was flat in the quarter but you also talked about being engaged with more cloud customers. So curious what you're seeing there. And then on the FPGA side, I think Victor and team, prior to the deal announcement, was pretty vocal about the long-term growth opportunity there as well.
