        "ceo_statement": "“Third quarter results came in below our expectations due to the softening PC market and substantial inventory reduction actions across the PC supply chain,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Despite the challenging macro environment, we grew revenue 29% year-over-year driven by increased sales of our data center, embedded and game console products. We are confident that our leadership product portfolio, strong balance sheet, and ongoing growth opportunities in our data center and embedded businesses position us well to navigate the current market dynamics.”",
        "cfo_statement": "“AMD reported third-quarter results in line with the preliminary results we announced last month. While we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded segments, each of which grew significantly year over year, our third-quarter results also reflect lower-than-expected Client segment revenue. Third-quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, up 29% from a year ago.\n\nGross margin was 50%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client revenue and $160 million of inventory, pricing, and related charges in the graphics and client businesses. Operating expenses were $1.5 billion, compared to $1 billion a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income was up 20% from a year ago to $1.3 billion, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 23%, compared to 24% a year ago due to higher operating expenses.\n\nNet income was $1.1 billion, up $202 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.67 per share, compared to $0.73 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower Client segment revenue.\n\n[Detailed segment analysis as provided in the summary.]"
