          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So, clearly, the PC business has been very volatile and underperformed for us in the third quarter. I think as we go into the fourth quarter, we are guiding that -- embedded in our guidance is that PCs will be down again in the fourth quarter. We believe that that will be a significant step in clearing inventory between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And of course, we'll monitor the macro conditions, but we'll certainly exit the year in a better place."

          "content": "Yeah. Sure. So, you know, on the server side, we certainly have been ramping up our overall supply. I think we've made good progress on that throughout the year. We have more supply in Q4 than we had earlier in the year. And some of those investments are coming online here in the fourth quarter. So, we expect as we go into 2023 with the Genoa launch not to be supply constrained based on what we currently see."

          "topic": "2023 Data Center Market Outlook",
          "content": "Yeah. So, it is a little bit early to talk about 2023 precisely, but maybe let me give you a backdrop of where we see the data center market today. As you said, in the near term, there are some overall macro headwinds that are affecting all markets, including the data center market. Now it varies by segment. And so, if I go through each of the segments, what we're seeing is I think North America cloud is probably the most resilient out of the segments within the data center market, and this is where AMD is the strongest. We've had very good progress at the North America cloud vendors. And we continue to believe that although there may be some near-term, let's call it, optimization of, let's call it, individual footprints, and efficiencies at individual cloud vendors over the medium term, as we go into 2023, we expect growth in that market, particularly customers moving more workloads to AMD, just given the strength of our product portfolio and overall -- Genoa coming forward. As we look through the other segments, I think China is -- has been very weak in 2022, and we're not forecasting a significant recovery in 2023. So, we'll see how that goes. And then on the enterprise side, I would say enterprise is probably most impacted by the macro. So, we have seen customers taking longer to make decisions and perhaps being a little bit more conservative on capex. That being said, though, we feel very good about our value proposition. We feel very good about our product portfolio. And we believe, even in a little bit of a choppy market that we can gain share across that business. So, overall, I think our Data Center trends are good, and we need to work through the macro, as everyone does."

          "topic": "Gross Margin Dynamics",
          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Stacy. So, I think if you look at the third quarter, it was -- there are a lot of dynamics in the Client business. So, market was weak. In particular, consumer was weak. And we have more of a footprint in consumer. So, in that framework, we saw units come down. But we also saw ASPs come down on a sequential basis. Now, I will say that ASPs were still up on a year-over-year basis. So, we've been, let's call it, disciplined in this pricing environment. We did see some pricing dynamics in the quarter, and we couldn't face unprofitable business. And we'll continue to be sort of watching that space. So, that was the pluses or minuses as it relates to Client ASPs. And as we go into the fourth quarter, again, I think we're forecasting for a competitive environment given the market weakness, and that's embedded in the guide."
        },
        {
          "topic": "U.S.-China Trade Impact",
          "content": "Yeah. Sure, Tim. So, we are certainly watching the situation very closely. Upon reviewing all of the new regulations as they have gone into effect, it is minimal impact on our revenue in the near term. We're certainly working very closely with commerce and the rest of the U.S. government on how those are rolling out. And then I think on a medium-term basis, again, my view on these things is we will always follow the U.S. regulations and understand the need for national security. The majority of our China business is, let's call it, non-data center. So, it's more in the PC business, as well as in some of the consumer-facing businesses. So, we are paying attention to that as we go forward in the business. But for the near term, we have not seen any significant impacts, and we'll continue to follow it very closely."

          "topic": "Free Cash Flow and Working Capital",
          "content": "I think, one, is when the revenue grows a lot, there's investment leader in working capital. So working capital numbers from an inventory and AR standpoint, they're up significantly year on year. We also have, as we said previously, a 3% tax rate going up to about 10%. And the cash taxes get paid. But the timing of the cash taxes sometimes is Q2. And in Q2, we did have some significant cash tax payment from a payment standpoint given the timing of payments of the federal government. And then you have timing of shipments that does affect the free cash flow. And the last thing I'll mention given the discussion, some of the questions that Lisa was asked about, supply for server and supply overall with the share gain of the growth of the business. We are making investments in capacity from a prepayment standpoint, and those obviously require funding the suppliers, and that also has an impact on the free cash flow because that flows through the free cash flow accretion. So this is really, if you look at it, inventory and capacity investing for growth and investing for the future."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Gross Margin Impact",
          "content": "No inventory hit, first of all, Toshi. On the gross margin, as you said, Q2, 54%. If you go all the way to Q4, 51% primarily is the weak PC market and Client margins coming down. For example, if you look at Q3, all other businesses were in line with expectations, and Client margins came in lower. We also have in the Data Center, a place cloud-weighted, which has lower ASPs. So, that also has an impact on margins. And then as Lisa mentioned earlier, some of the new capacity that we have from a supply standpoint, there are some additional costs from the supply capacity agreements. And those are all baked in into the Q4 51% margin guidance."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Purchase Commitments and Full-Year Guidance",
          "content": "Yeah. So, if you look at our second half guidance, and maybe let's talk about the full-year guidance. We have -- there are some puts and takes in how we're seeing the business today. So whenever we guide, we recognize that there are multiple dynamics that we're looking at. In the current guidance for the full year and the second half, what we're saying is that we continue to see strong demand in the data center, in our embedded business, as well as in the console business. And we are being more conservative in our PC outlook. Our PC outlook now at mid-teens would kind of put the market at somewhere around, let's call it, 290 million to 300 million units. So, I do think we've appropriately derisked the PC business. As it relates to inventory, as we look at the current situation, given some of the COVID lockdowns and things in the second quarter. I think there was a bit of buildup in PC inventory, and we've taken that into account in the second half. We think the AMD portion of that is modest. And as a result, it will rebalance itself in the second half of the year. So, overall, I think we feel very good about the second half. And again, with the portfolio that we have, one of the things that has been important is we were still supply constrained in several of the areas. Certainly, on the embedded side, we were supply constrained in the second quarter. And even on the server side, we were tight in the second quarter. We have additional supply that's coming online, especially as we get toward the end of the year. That will help us really meet more of the demand from customers. So, we feel pretty good about all of those puts and takes."

        "Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I have one question and one quick follow-up. I guess as we look at your Client piece of the business being down sequentially in the current quarter, as we work through inventory digestion at your customers, I'm curious just how you're thinking about kind of the clearing out of that inventory. Do you think we find a bottom coming out of the December quarter? Or any kind of thoughts of just that kind of full expectation of reflection of inventory in the PC market for you guys?",
        "Yeah. And then as a quick follow-up on the service side of the business, I think in the past, you've talked about your ability to shift being somewhat supply constrained. I'm just curious if you have an update on the supply situation in the server CPU, especially as we look toward the general processor ramp in the next quarter or two."

        "Thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to ask a question on the outlook for 2023, specifically in the server CPU business. I know it's early and difficult to predict. But given the supply comment that you just made, given what you're hearing from customers, both on the cloud side, as well as the enterprise side, and the ramp of your new products, how are you thinking about the positives there versus the macro, which continues to be a headwind? I think many of us have your business growing in Data Center kind of in the 20% to 30% range. Is that a fair place to be? Or is that a little too optimistic given what you know today?",
        "And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margins, maybe for Devinder. So, you're guiding Q4 gross margins up about 100 basis points, which is good to see, but you're still 300 basis points below where you were in Q2. And since then, obviously, Client is down significantly. Your Data Center business is very resilient and so is the classic Xilinx business. So, from a mix perspective, you should be in a better place. What's driving down gross margins in Q4, I guess, versus Q2? Are you recognizing another inventory hit? Or is it something else? Thank you."

Is there -- I don't know how linear those -- particularly that business is. Is there any sort of -- is there any material impact from that extra week?",
        "Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about units versus pricing in Q3 and Q4. I know in Q3, you specifically mentioned pricing has an impact. And it sounds like you're suggesting Client margins are coming down. I don't know if that's just a cost or if there's a pricing impact as well. But like what did units and pricing do in Client in Q3? And what are you expecting in Q4?"

        "Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I just wanted to clarify what is the client revenue we should be thinking about for Q4? Is it $800 million, $900 million? Any help there? And then, I guess, Lisa, the bigger question there is, what does client recovery look like? Do you get back to the $2 billion quarterly rate? Do you get to $1.5 billion? And I asked that because your competitor was suggesting that next year, the PC TAM would only be down 4% or 5%, which seems a little bit optimistic. What do you think AMD is kind of -- what kind of PC TAM does AMD have in mind for next year so that we get a sense for how this derisk the model is from a PC perspective?",
        "And then I had a follow-up for you, Devinder, maybe one for you on gross margins. How much of the write-offs and pricing actions that you're taking in -- that you took in Q3 and are taking in Q4? How much are they recoverable in Q1? So, let's say, hypothetically, Q1 revenue is the same as Q4 revenue. What can gross margins be? How much of the actions are recoverable? And basically, how do you start getting back to the prior trend of 54% gross margin because the longer-term target is over 57%? So, if Client revenues don't really grow that much, are there actions that can help you get back to your prior gross margin trajectory? Thank you."

        "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Lisa. At least I have one question on the Data Center segment and then a follow-up on Client. On the Data Center business, if you look back to the pre-announcement a month ago, I think there was a little bit of maybe -- you came in a little bit under where we were modeling, I'll just say that way. And so, I got a ton of questions on that, and I was really interested in some of the comments that you made in your script about how cloud revenue still more than doubled year over year. And anyway, just confirming that I got that right. And maybe if you could help us break down your Data Center business a little bit between the strength in cloud that I would expect to continue given the capex commentary we've heard, but there were obviously some headwinds from enterprise that you called out and clearly from HPC, both on CPU and GPU. So, I think that would be helpful to just break it down because I was surprised that that cloud revenue was as strong as it was given where the numbers came in in the quarter. Thank you.",
        "Thank you, Lisa. That's helpful, I think, to highlight the cloud momentum continuing. I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to kind of revisit what we've learned over the last three or four months in the PC market. It's super dynamic times out there. And obviously, things have changed in demand really, really quickly from when you guys guided back at the beginning of August until the pre-announcement. I just kind of wanted to walk back through sort of the dynamics of how the quarter progressed from when you guys gave the original guidance. I guess, obviously, the market went down. There was inventory corrections and whatnot. But just how quickly did you guys see that? And I guess the real question coming out of this is, how are you thinking about changes you might make in monitoring inventory levels or working with your channel partners? Just any changes you're thinking about making operationally to the business to sort of protect from this kind of thing coming and, I guess, going forward? Any color there would be really helpful."

Can you give relatively similar color for Data Center and Embedded just because the volatility between segments, obviously, has been huge over the last couple of quarters?",
        "Great. That's perfect. And then as my follow-up, one for either you or Devinder. As we think about opex for next year, how do you guys philosophically balance the desire to stick to your business model that you laid out at your most recent Analyst Day versus the desire to continue to spend, continue to gain market share, put out the great new products and execute that you've done so well?

There's such a big disparity between your 3Q guide and what Intel guided to or reported versus what they're guiding to in 4Q. And usually, things normalize over a longer period of time. But I just wanted to understand, is it a case of they took their medicine earlier and AMD continued to over-ship versus demand? Just kind of help us understand. And there seems to be also a dynamic that Intel is raising pricing in 4Q. So, there was some pull-in ahead of that. And I have -- I've been getting a lot of questions myself. I don't understand specific disparity. So, any help would be very helpful.",

And we had this conversation at the Analyst Day about the headwind to free cash flow given your need or desire to secure capacity. Is that going to temper off now -- taper off as we go through the remainder of the next few quarters as there should be more capacity that's available, plus on the PC side, you should need much less than what you needed a couple of quarters ago?
