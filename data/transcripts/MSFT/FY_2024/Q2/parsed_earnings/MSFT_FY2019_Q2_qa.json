          "topic": "Timeframe for Privacy-Focused Social Platform",
          "content": "For the timeframe, this is going to be a central focus of the company for the next five years or longer. WhatsApp and Messenger are strong in many parts of the world, but in some key markets like the U.S. and Japan, we need to get the basics right and become the clear best service. We’ll share more details at F8, including our product roadmap. We’re also taking a longer period before rolling out certain changes—like end-to-end encryption for all private communications—to ensure we have the right safety measures in place. This is a long-term strategy, so I don’t expect it to be a major contributor to the business in the next couple of years, but it’s where we’re headed."

          "topic": "Long-Term Vision for Commerce and Payments",
          "content": "Commerce and payments offer a big opportunity across all services. On Instagram and Facebook, we have shopping features; on Marketplace, people can buy and sell directly; and for messaging (WhatsApp, Messenger), the private nature makes it natural for people to interact with businesses. We’re testing payments in WhatsApp in India and hope to expand. Over time, as we make it easier for people to buy directly and follow up with businesses via messaging, it’ll create more value. While monetization near-term is via ads, over the long run these commerce experiences may also open different revenue streams."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Watch and Content Engagement",
          "content": "Watch is still early but progressing well. Over 100 million people use Watch daily. The big question was whether people would go to a separate tab to interact around video content, and they are. This success suggests people want more experiences like this, and it opens opportunities for other verticals, like news. With Watch’s growth, we see that distinct content experiences can work within our apps."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Future Business Model (Ads vs. Commerce)",
          "content": "Advertising will remain our primary revenue model for the foreseeable future. As we build more commerce-related features, the primary impact will be helping businesses better convert customers they reach through ads, which should increase advertiser demand. Long term, if payments and commerce become significant, there could be new revenue models, but near-term we’ll focus on delivering value and letting that strengthen our advertising business."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Approach to Safety and Harmful Content",
          "content": "Given the volume of content, AI is critical for proactive enforcement before people see harmful posts. In areas like Al Qaeda/ISIS terrorism content, we remove more than 99% proactively. Our goal is to increase this across categories like hate speech and bullying. Over time, we want to report the prevalence of harmful content and what percent we detect proactively to show progress. It’s an area of heavy ongoing investment."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Regulation and Global Frameworks",
          "content": "We are encouraging clear regulation in areas like harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability. Different countries move at different paces, but we hope to establish global frameworks where possible. Europe led with GDPR, and they’re thinking about content regulation as well. We expect different timelines and regulations, but we want consistent, clear standards we can work with globally."

          "topic": "Stories Ads Adoption and Creative Tools",
          "content": "Consumers adopt new formats faster than marketers. We saw this with mobile and now with Stories. We need to help advertisers move quickly to Stories. We’re making it easier by enabling auto-creation of Stories ads and building tools that let advertisers provide simple assets, while we optimize placement. Over time, we aim to automate more, so advertisers can rely on our systems to place ads in the best formats. We’ve seen incremental results: for example, adding Facebook Stories ads drove a 26% increase in checkout additions for a jewelry brand. Some cannibalization from feed is inevitable, but over time we hope to increase overall advertiser spend by proving ROI."

        {
          "topic": "IGTV and Checkout on Instagram",
          "content": "For checkout on Instagram, it’s in a very early closed beta with 23 brands. This is about improving the user experience—allowing people to buy products without leaving the app. While this could strengthen ROI for advertisers by closing the loop, it’s not primarily about near-term monetization. It will take time to roll it out more broadly. For IGTV, it’s also early. We’re focused on learning what works and giving people places to engage deeply with content."

          "topic": "Stories Monetization and Pricing",
          "content": "Stories impressions are growing rapidly and contributed the most to total impression growth this quarter. However, these impressions come at lower prices, creating a short-term headwind on revenue growth. Over time, we plan to introduce more effective direct response units in Stories and attract more advertisers, which should improve pricing, but this will take years, not quarters."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Ad Targeting Headwinds and Regulatory Impact",
          "content": "We face targeting headwinds from multiple factors: evolving regulations like GDPR, platform changes that make measurement more difficult, and our own product changes (like new tools for clearing off-Facebook activity and restricting targeting options). These will be more pronounced in the second half of the year. We’re seeing more people opt out of third-party data usage, leading to less relevant ads."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Expenses, CapEx, and Margin Outlook",
          "content": "We continue investing aggressively in safety, security, and innovation. There’s no change in our long-term view that we’ll spend heavily in these areas. We’ve improved visibility into the pacing of hiring and infrastructure projects, which slightly lowered our 2019 expense forecast. But the need to invest remains, and we anticipate that operating margin will be negatively impacted long-term by these investments."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Ad Load and Impression Growth",
          "content": "Total impression growth is up, driven primarily by Instagram Stories, then Instagram Feed. Instagram Stories adds more supply but at lower prices. Instagram Feed ad load has increased year-over-year, but we expect fewer increments going forward. Facebook Feed also contributed with growth outside the U.S. and Canada. Over time, increased Stories engagement and improved ad formats should help monetize these impressions better."
