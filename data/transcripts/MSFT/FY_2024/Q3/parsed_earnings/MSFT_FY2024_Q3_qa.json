          "content": "Thank you, Keith, for the question. Let me start, and then Amy, you could add.\n\nAt a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this. There is training and there’s inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that’s on the training side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay in the leadership position there. And we’ve done that successfully all the way today, and you’ve seen it flow through our P&L. And you can continue to see that, going forward."

          "topic": "Azure Demand Drivers",
          "content": "On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the – we’re fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a port of call for pretty much anybody who is doing any AI project. And so, that’s sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos I even referenced in my remarks are new Azure customers. That’s one.\n\nThe second thing that we are also seeing is AI just doesn’t sit on its own. AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT, is one of the fastest growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI, and so, Cosmos DB integration. The data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great attraction. We are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI.\n\nAnd lastly, I would say migrations to Azure as well. This is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers. I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there’s always an optimization cycle, but there’s also, as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow, and then they’ll optimize. It’s a continuous side of it.\n\nThese are the three trends that are playing out on Azure, in terms of what, at least, we see on demand side."

          "topic": "Generative AI Impact on Tech Stack",
          "content": "Yeah, I think it’s going to have a very, very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes. Everything from power, power density to the datacenter design to what used to be the accelerator now is sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so, I think, I think every workload changes.\n\nTake our data layer. The most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let’s separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute, we’ll have traditional SQL. We’ll have Spark. And by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lake house pattern. And then the business model, you can combine all of those different computes.\n\nThat’s the type of compute architecture. That’s just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean, if you think about Copilot, Copilot extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps through the Copilot stack, that’s another sort of part of what’s happening to the tech stack.\n\nYeah, I mean, I definitely believe being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI, but now AI is just redefining what it means to have – what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Copilot Strategy and Partner Ecosystem",
          "content": "Yeah, it’s a great question. The way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes. It’s not like when people do knowledge work, they’re not doing knowledge work, they’re doing knowledge work in support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you. That’s the first thing to know. And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you.\n\nNow we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools, with the workflow, and the business process and the business process data. When we think about our copilot, our copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it’s with ServiceNow, where it has the ability to integrate with SAP, with Salesforce, with obviously, Dynamics. That’s what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you’ll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility. And Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited, because one of the things in the enterprise is you want to ground your copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications. And Copilot Studio is the tool to use it to make that happen.\n\nAnd so, that’s what we are seeing, which is we are building a copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all these other copilots, which, to us, appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, because when you think about Teams, when you’re having a meeting, you’re not doing a random meeting. The meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you’re trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so, now you can access all of that data right in the Teams context.\n\nThat’s, I think, what’s exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say were underappreciated for the amount of work, how people use those tools to make progress on business process. But we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools more horizontally."

          "content": "And maybe, Amy, you could add.\n\nAnd I think in some ways, it’s important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that’s represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so, when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of, quote unquote, cloud infrastructure is important. It’s important because we’ve been the leader through this decade of the cloud transition, and it’s important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first.\n\nAnd I think that’s really the best way to think about how we’ll spend, is the same way we approached it for a decade. Watch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation, and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add, and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."

          "topic": "Commercial Growth in Volatile Environment",
          "content": "In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that’s what we’re talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings so that when we’re asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services, those come with real promises of high value scenarios. And so, I think that is an important piece as you think about stability and commercial demand."

          "topic": "Operating Margins and AI Investments",
          "content": "Thanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams have obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that Q2, because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you’re seeing larger margin improvement than I would say is sort of a run rate margin improvement. Let me first say that.\n\nSecondly, the absolute margin improvement is also been very good. And it speaks of, I think, one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that we want, really, to make sure when we’re making investments, we’re making them in consistency across the tech stack.\n\nThe tech stack we’re building, no matter what team it’s on, is inclusive of AI enablement. And so, think about it as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It’s been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work. And I think that’s important, because it means you’re shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use, but in what people are working on, day to day. That does obviously, create a leverage opportunity.\n\nThere’s also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products. We talked about it with Office 365. We talked about it in Azure Core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we’ve seen materially, improvements over the course of the year.\n\nAnd so, when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of re-pivoting a workforce toward the AI-first work we’re doing without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage. And we still need to be investing. And so, the important part, invest toward the thing that’s going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments.\n\nAnd so, it’s a great question, and hopefully that helps piece apart a few of the components."

          "topic": "AI Services Growth and Infrastructure Scaling",
          "content": "Karl, I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you’ve seen it scale through that process. And that is going toward, as we talked about, servers and also new datacenter footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand, and really changing demand, as we look forward.\n\nAnd so, I do feel like the teams have done a very good job. I feel like primarily, obviously, this is being built by us, but we’ve also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us, in terms of meeting customer demand. And I tend to think, looking forward, you’ll tend to see, and I guided toward it, accelerating capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline."
        },
        {
          "topic": "AI Services Tailwind",
          "content": "And maybe I’ll just add just a few things to that. I think whether you use the word “lapping” these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, it’s all sort of the same thing. That we’re getting to that point in H2, that’s absolutely true. We’d like to talk about the contribution of AI, specifically for the reasons Satya talked about.\n\nThis is starting to see the application of AI at scale, and we want to be able to show people this is how that’s going to look. It’s inferencing workloads. Where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue. And so, I do think about those as both related.\n\nAnd ultimately, the TAM that we go after is best thought of as across both of those, both AI workload and, I guess, quote unquote, non-AI workload, although, to Satya’s point, you need all of it."

          "topic": "Office 365 Seat Growth and RPU",
          "content": "That’s a great question, Brad. And maybe I’ll split apart the components, and then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually, believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectories. And I’ll explain why I say that.\n\nSeat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small medium-sized businesses and really, frontline workers scenarios. And to your point, on occasion, those are lower RPU seats, but they’re also new seats. And so, you see that in the seat count number. And as we get through, and we’ve seen that come down a little bit, quarter over quarter, and we’ve guided for that really to happen again next quarter.\n\nBut a very separate thing is being able to add RPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that’s come over time from E3, then from E5. And we’re continuing to see very healthy suite momentum, and you heard very good renewals. All of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth.\n\nThen the next thing that actually, we just talked about, maybe in Brad’s question, I’m trying to recall, is that you’re going to see Copilot revenue will land there as RPU, right? That won’t show a seat growth. You’ll have E3, E5 transitions, Copilot all show up in RPU over time. And then you’ll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios.\n\nI tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines. Believe it or not, I think about them as sort of unique, independent motions where we run. And there’s still room for seat growth, and obviously, with the levers we’ve talked about, there’s room for RPU growth as well."

And there’s media speculation of more spending ahead, with some reports talking about $100 billion datacenter.\n\nObviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution, but what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how you use the management team to try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments, because they are getting very big, and maybe if you give us some hints on whether there’s any truth to the potential of $100 billion datacenter out there."

And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation?\n\nAnd Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure?
