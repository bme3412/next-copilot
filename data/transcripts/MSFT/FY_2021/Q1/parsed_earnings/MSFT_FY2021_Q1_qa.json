While there was some pull-forward demand due to SQL Server and Windows Server expirations, the underlying drivers like hybrid licensing and premium services ensure that growth remains robust over time. This durability is reflected in our continued investment in infrastructure and our ability to effectively meet customer needs."

These factors have enabled significant gross margin enhancements without relying on one-time benefits. Moving forward, Azure gross margins will continue to benefit from these structural improvements, even as the rate of margin growth moderates."

            "topic": "Windows OEM Revenue and Migration Tailwind",
            "content": "Windows OEM revenue is sustained by continued low inventory levels due to ongoing chip supply constraints. The tailwind from the Win7/Win10 migration is expected to extend for a few more quarters, particularly as small and medium businesses continue their transitions. In the volume licensing and commercial segments, we see double-digit billings and strong demand driven by our Microsoft 365 value proposition, which helps offset any short-term fluctuations in OEM revenue."

This improvement is sustainable due to ongoing structural improvements, cost per unit reductions, and a shift towards higher-margin premium services. As Azure continues to grow and consumption-based services expand, we expect gross margins to continue improving, although the rate of improvement may moderate as revenue mixes shift towards IaaS and PaaS."

Customers value the flexibility to deploy workloads either on-premise or in the cloud based on their needs. Approximately one-third of our Windows and SQL Server customers are utilizing hybrid rights, which allows them to optimize their deployments and maintain flexibility. This trend is durable and supports continued growth in our on-premise business."
