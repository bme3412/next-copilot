        "Amy, I wanted to ask you about the PBP guide for your third quarter, the March quarter. It was comfortably above where everybody, I think, is modeling. And in particular, I wanted to ask you about Office 365. Of all the businesses, the larger ones in Microsoft, most of the upside in this recent quarter, except perhaps for Office 365, where despite the migration to E5 and despite the free-to-paid seat conversion, we really didn’t see an acceleration in Office 365. I’m wondering if you could perhaps unpack that and describe why and part two to the question is your guide for that segment is so good in the March quarter that one would infer that the Office 365 growth is likely to accelerate in March. I’m wondering if you could confirm whether that’s a reasonable assumption. Thanks so much."

        "I wanted to dig into one of the topics that you mentioned in your introduction, and that’s kind of Teams working as a framework across all of your solutions and sort of connecting more and more people into the Microsoft framework. I was doing some calls this quarter and asking about a competitor’s acquisition of a Team’s competitor. And a lot of people in the channel talked to me about how Teams was pulling through Dynamic CRM, right, and they understood that acquisition as a defense against that. And I was surprised to hear that, that there would be a linkage between the two. Can you help us, one, kind of understand how Teams pulls in additional products behind it, and two, the connection between Teams and how they get a broader base of frontline workers into the story for Microsoft, because I think most people think about Microsoft as, like, an information worker story? But frontline workers is another huge area for you guys to go after."

And maybe, Satya, you could perhaps comment on this as well. Are you expecting a fuller return to the office and fuller resumption of business travel over time, such that that expense profile wouldn’t look very different?"

You’ve got Dynamics that’s performing really well and sounds like is accelerating. Just wondering how you’re looking at that market more broadly as an opportunity for the company."

But as we look forward, are there any puts and takes that we should be aware of, or should we just focus on cash flow growing pretty much in line with net income? Thanks."
