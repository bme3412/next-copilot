        "We’re seeing these really great commercial bookings result come through 39% growth in the current quarter. And Satya, you’ve been talking to us a lot about these more strategic deals and the acceleration of digital transformation. Can you give us a little bit of color on what comes in these more strategic deals? How does it change the dynamics of what types of solutions people are using from Microsoft, the scope of how deeply you’re getting into these customers, and how much of the IT budget you’re getting? And then maybe talk just a little bit about the timeframe for which this comes into revenues. What should our expectation be, when you get one of these big strategic deals? How long does it take to really ramp up this customer onto the broader Microsoft?"
