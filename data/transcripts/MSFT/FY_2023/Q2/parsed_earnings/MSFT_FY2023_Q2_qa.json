          "content": "Thank you so much, Keith, for the questions. As you know, we started the OpenAI partnership now three and a half years ago. And we’ve been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last three years. And so, I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI. And we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves, and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack, and also create new solutions and new opportunities.\n\nWhenever we think about platform opportunities and platform shift opportunities, that’s how we come at it. How can we essentially ride the wave for everything that we have today and make it more expansive? And then what new can be created? If you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute, storage and network come together. That’s, in some sense, under the radar, if you will. For the last three and a half, four years, we’ve been working very, very hard to build both the training supercomputers, and now of course, the inference infrastructure, because once you use AI inside of your applications, it goes from just being training heavy to inference. That’s sort of, I think, core Azure itself has been transformed and the infrastructure business is being transformed.\n\nAnd so, you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services, even. Think about what Synapse plus OpenAI APIs can do. You already have the Power Platform incorporated capability. You can prompt a workflow. I mean, one of the reasons why we’re the leaders in robotic process automation and workflow automation today is because of some of the AI capabilities that we have in there. GitHub Copilot is, in fact, I would say the most at-scale LLF-based product out there in the marketplace today.\n\nAnd so, we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it’s in productivity, whether it’s in our consumer services. And so, we’re excited about it, but I think that we’re also excited about OpenAI’s own innovation, right? They commercialized their products. We’re excited about the ChatGPT being built on Azure and having the traction it has.\n\nWe look to both there is an investment part to it and there’s a commercial partnership, but fundamentally, it’s going to be something that’s going to drive, I think, innovation and competitive differentiation in every one of the Microsoft solutions by leading in AI."

          "content": "Thank you, Brent. First of all, I was making a comment which was sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean, I always sort of subscribe to that there’s only one law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world, and then how many times that do we grow, because, as I said, even I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher, and on a secular basis. The question is, how many times is it, given the overall inflation adjusted economic growth? That’s kind of how I look at it.\n\nGiven that, I think the two things that we see, we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it’s even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic, they’re making sure that they’re getting most value out of it or optimizing it, and then also being a bit more cautious on, given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market.\n\nGiven those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they’ll plow into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up.\n\nAnd so, one of the key things we’re watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this phase through our value propositions, and even build loyalty with our customers so that, long term, we are well positioned for share gain. That’s sort of fundamentally how we view it.\n\nAnd then the other aspect, I’d also say, is simultaneously investing in this new AI trend, because I don’t think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They’re all going to have considerations around how does my AI inference performance cost model is going to look like. And that’s where we are well-positioned again.\n\nThat’s how I view it. The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what’s happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads. And that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up."

          "topic": "Azure Guidance and Revenue Growth",
          "content": "Thanks, Keith, and I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point better, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point worse.\n\nAnd I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads.\n\nAnd as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so, it’s this nuance of you’re still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business. And yet, you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth.\n\nWe saw that across all segments. If there was one segment where I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point I know that people are focused on.\n\nBut if you step back and say, this is how you drive ultimate share gains, and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company, and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well.\n\nAnd so, as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it’s in customer success, whether it’s in optimizations, whether it’s, frankly, in engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us, even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity and TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in tech and technology."

          "content": "Thanks, Mark. You’re right and let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you’re referring to, we had good what we would call long dated growth, which means we’re having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform.\n\nAnd that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so, it’s about both the optimization that you’re talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workflows starting. And those also may not be matched up, one to one, to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility.\n\nThe other piece of it, Mark, that we didn’t talk on before because I was really focused on consumption, is that there per-user headwinds as well, right, because we’re getting, seeing some of these laws of large numbers, in terms of the per-seat business.\n\nSo, there’s a couple of things going on here, Mark, against, as you said, a very large base. It’s not just the optimization to new workloads. It’s also some per-user work as well."

          "topic": "Microsoft 365 and SMB Market",
          "content": "It’s a good question because you’ve continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways, because we’re focusing on frontline workers scenarios. We’re continuing to focus on small and midsize business growth, and we’re adding new things to which you can grow, whether that’s Viva, whether it’s Teams. There’s new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value, and then to add seats.\n\nAnd so, I don’t want to say it has to be, again, this vision of “or.” So, I think you’ll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what we’ve been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we’ve added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well.\n\nAnd so, you will see, right, over time, long term, the seat growth move a little bit, and then you’ll see ASP show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more RPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there’s room to do both those things, and I’ve felt that way now for a couple of years."

          "topic": "Operating Margins and AI Investments",
          "content": "That’s a good question, especially because this quarter, you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question, and I’ll just reinforce it, as we see some of these moderating seat growth, whether that’s some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the standalone stuff, you’re starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. It does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number.\n\nWe’re seeing still good seat growth, still growth across all workloads. And, as you’re pointing seen, I want to say, four or five really good quarters of E5 adoption. The value there is just very high for customers in this environment, between analytics, security, and I think we’ve given some, I think, good security data points in terms of adoption, and voice. This is a place where customers can save money by moving to this suite. And I do think you’re starting to see some of that ARPU help.\n\nAnd then, Satya talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user, where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates, and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product, where the cycle is going to be a little longer, you’re going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5. You can see the ARPU growth, and you can see the consistency, potentially, in both renewal rate and frankly within Microsoft 365 performance."

          "content": "Brad, listen, thanks for that question. Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low single-digit operating expense growth,\n\nwe start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year, and we lap the acquisitions, both of Nuance and Xander. By the time that gets to the end of Q4, you’ll see very moderated headcount growth on a year over year basis, in addition to some of the prioritization decisions we’ve made.\n\nAnd you’re right, we take decisions like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue just incredibly seriously, because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that.\n\nAnd so, I do think that we feel confident in that exit rate. As I said, it’ll certainly imply that year over year growth as we lap some of the investment that we made will be quite small."
