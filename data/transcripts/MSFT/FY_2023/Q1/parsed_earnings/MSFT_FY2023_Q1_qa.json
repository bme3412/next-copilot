            "content": "Thank you, Keith. Let me start and then Amy can add to this. I think I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what’s the product shape of the product portfolio? What we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix, I’ll call it, infrastructure meters, as well as SaaS applications. That’s the first thing that we’re looking at, and how is that value landing with customers and what’s the growth rate. When I think about what’s happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we are getting recurring customers or customers coming back, buying more seats, or GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it, what’s happening in the contact center with Dynamics. I would say, and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that’s the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the capex spend. Basically, that’s the demand signal, because you’ve got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center built, but 60+% is the kit. That only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? That’s, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle, even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the datacenter, which, by the way, we don’t even construct things fully. We can even have things which are semi-constructed. We call co-shells and so on. We know how to manage our capex spend to build out a long-term asset. And a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling our training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. I would say it’s more important to manage to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that’s driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it’s in consumer side, whether it’s on commercial per-seat side, or the consumption meters. That’s, I think, the fundamental driver."

            "content": "Yeah, it’s a great question. The way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes. It’s not like when people do knowledge work, they’re not doing knowledge work, they’re doing knowledge work in support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you. That’s the first thing to know. And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you.\n\nNow we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools, with the workflow, and the business process and the business process data. When we think about our copilot, our copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it’s with ServiceNow, where it has the ability to integrate with SAP, with Salesforce, with obviously, Dynamics. That’s what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you’ll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility. And Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited, because one of the things in the enterprise is you want to ground your copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications. And Copilot Studio is the tool to use it to make that happen.\n\nAnd so, that’s what we are seeing, which is we are building a copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all these other copilots, which, to us, appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, because when you think about Teams, when you’re having a meeting, you’re not doing a random meeting. The meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you’re trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so, now you can access all of that data right in the Teams context.\n\nThat’s, I think, what’s exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say were underappreciated for the amount of work, how people use those tools to make progress on business process. But we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools more horizontally."

            "content": "Yeah. I mean, I think that that’s the only thing I would add, Amy, to your point, is that obviously, our investment profile here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good growth rates with the kind of volatility you’re seeing. So, we’re going to stay focused on it. And in this particular period, I think we are going to optimize for long-term customer loyalty by proactively helping them optimize this spend, which I think is the right thing for us to be doing, as a company on behalf of our shareholders, long term."

            "content": "Thanks, Keith, and I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point better, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point worse.\n\nAnd I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads.\n\nAnd as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so, it’s this nuance of you’re still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business. And yet, you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth.\n\nWe saw that across all segments. If there was one segment where I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point I know that people are focused on.\n\nBut if you step back and say, this is how you drive ultimate share gains, and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company, and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well.\n\nAnd so, as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it’s in customer success, whether it’s in optimizations, whether it’s, frankly, in engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us, even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity and TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in tech and technology."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. You’re right and let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you’re referring to, we had good what we would call long dated growth, which means we’re having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform.\n\nAnd that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so, it’s about both the optimization that you’re talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workflows starting. And those also may not be matched up, one to one, to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility.\n\nThe other piece of it, Mark, that we didn’t talk on before because I was really focused on consumption, is that there per-user headwinds as well, right, because we’re getting, seeing some of these laws of large numbers, in terms of the per-seat business.\n\nSo, there’s a couple of things going on here, Mark, against, as you said, a very large base. It’s not just the optimization to new workloads. It’s also some per-user work as well."

            "topic": "Microsoft 365 and SMB Market",
            "content": "It’s a good question because you’ve continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways, because we’re focusing on frontline workers scenarios. We’re continuing to focus on small and midsize business growth, and we’re adding new things to which you can grow, whether that’s Viva, whether it’s Teams. There’s new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value, and then to add seats.\n\nAnd so, I don’t want to say it has to be, again, this vision of “or.” So, I think you’ll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what we’ve been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we’ve added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well.\n\nAnd so, you will see, right, over time, long term, the seat growth move a little bit, and then you’ll see ASP show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more RPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there’s room to do both those things, and I’ve felt that way now for a couple of years."

            "content": "Yes, that’s exactly right. Maybe I’ll just repeat it just so people can hear it in my words, as well, to that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end at 30%. You’re exactly right, the distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non-AI consumption, really made the difference in that number. And we’ve assumed that going forward into H1, inclusive of my guide in 28 to 29, going forward.\n\nAnd then let me separate, which was your larger point, which is what are the other factors you see ongoing. Number one, you’re right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure, remained in Q4 and will remain in H1. Hopefully, that’s helpful."

            "topic": "Operating Margins and AI Investments",
            "content": "And maybe, Amy, you could add just a couple of things to that. I think the first is, could we see consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number, or something that continues to accelerate. And the answer to that is yes, because there’s two different pieces. You’re seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned. The pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs, or GPUs, will be demand driven. And so, if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we’ve done for, I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect. And we’ll use all that same learning and demandsignal understanding to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so, you’re right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns, and yet see these inconsistencies in capital spend, quarter to quarter.\n\nThe other thing I would note, Kash, is you’ll also notice there’s a growing distinction between our capex number and, on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E. And you’re going to start to see that more often in this period, because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so, you’ll see a little bit more volatility. I’ve mentioned that in my comments before, but I mention it again, just because you’re starting to see that distinction in my comments. And hopefully, that’s helpful context."

            "content": "No, I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what look more like, to us, a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long term. And Satya mentioned things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we’re really encouraged by some of the progress and how we’re making progress with Game Pass, as well, with some of the new announcements."

And because of that, actually, we, to your point, have signed up with third parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity. We’ve done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit, as we’ve talked about, in builds so that we can get back in a more balanced place."

And there’s media speculation of more spending ahead, with some reports talking about $100 billion datacenter.\n\nObviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution, but what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how you use the management team to try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments, because they are getting very big, and maybe if you give us some hints on whether there’s any truth to the potential of $100 billion datacenter out there."
