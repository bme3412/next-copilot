          "topic": "Generative AI Adoption Pace",
          "content": "Thank you, Keith, for the question. The fundamental guidance and conversation that we have with customers is twofold. One is the easiest path to value for generative AI is to adopt certain solutions. For example, GitHub Copilot, in some sense, it’s sort of the no-brainer to add productivity leverage for all of the software developers in any organization. Whether you’re a bank, you’re a retailer or you’re a software company, it applies to everyone. That’s probably one of the things that we are seeing very good even productivity data and great adoption.\n\nAnd then obviously the excitement that there is already around the M365 Copilot. The first thing we sort of talked about is how we ourselves are deploying all these copilots across, whether it’s Sales Copilot or M365 Copilot or GitHub Copilot, how do you get maximum value out of these horizontal toolchains? And then on top of that, we have taken what we did underneath these products and built it out as a first-class tech stack, which we talked about at our developer conference called the Copilot Stack, and then with Azure AI tooling, made it possible for someone like Moody’s or to build their own copilots for their people. To us, we want to be able to help customers build their generative AI applications on top of Azure AI and with speed, if you will.\n\nAnd so, those are the two things that we asked them to identify where they can get the maximum productivity leverage, and then we even swarm with our own resources to help them get those things done. And the last comment I’d make is the cloud and data in the cloud enables all this, because I think the diffusion cycle here is, in some sense, we have a new set of cloud meters that are getting adopted faster because of everything else that came before it in the cloud. Those would be the observations."

          "topic": "AI Regulation and Governance",
          "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Rishi, for the question. Overall, we’ve taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that, from day one, we think about as first class, and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. For example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles. We translated the AI principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process, that then we hold ourselves to internal audit, essentially. That’s the framework we have.\n\nWe have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are, and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process. And so, we feel very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. And so, we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction. But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in the AI, I think we stand to gain from that."

          "topic": "OpenAI Partnership Accounting",
          "content": "Thanks, Keith. In some ways, let me start by saying it’s a great partnership. We’re proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you’ve heard us make more recently. And we’ve talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits. When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us.\n\nBut specifically to your question on how does it show up, it’s easiest in this situation to think about them as a customer of ours, like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI Services in service of supporting their end customers. And so, when they do that, like any other customer who has a commercial relationship with us, we recognize revenue on that behalf. That’s probably the simplest frame, Keith, that I hope is helpful."

          "topic": "Gross Margins for Generative AI Technologies",
          "content": "Yes, Karl, I think it's a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is you look at all of the businesses we’re in, and we look at our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is where Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute. And I’ll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains.\n\nRight now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that Satya’s talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that, while we continue to focus on our customers’ success and getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that’s the E5 product of Microsoft 365, whether that’s Windows 365 to help. Maybe it’s on compute costs and PC cost, whether it’s working across the Azure stack. And so, if we feel like, and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say great. And we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about. We’ll increase COGS growth, but we’re committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low.\n\nAnd so, what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future, to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. While I know that’s not giving specificity, it is in fact how we think about long-term success, is being well-positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we’re going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the buildout. We will charge for those AI capabilities, and then ultimately, we’ll deliver operating profit."

        "Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a great fiscal year. Satya, you started out your comments talking about how every customer conversation has the customer asking you about utilizing generative AI technology and how fast they could utilize that generative AI technology. What’s the answer? What do you tell them in terms of the pace with which that could get into the marketplace and your customers could start using it?\n\nAnd then for Amy, how should investors think about just the fundamental gross margins behind these generative AI technologies? We understand there’s going to be a lot of CapEx to ramp up underneath these, but what should we expect in terms of what the ultimate gross margin looks like underneath all these new generative AI solutions? Thank you."

        "I’d like to drill into Azure, and more specifically, Azure IaaS PaaS consumption. IaaS PaaS consumption is really stepped down recently, and it’s important to understand the macro versus an optimization that will rebound, whether it’s going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue? In other words, is this simply purely macro, and everyone is stepping back a little bit, and they’re going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back, or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that that slowdown to sustain even when the IT spending rebound?"

        "Amy, if I could double-click a little bit on the exciting news around M365 Copilot, as everybody on the line looks to layer that opportunity into our models, I just wanted to get your views. Are there any guardrails you’d offer us to sort of keep us in line? Is there a degree of gross margin pressure in the Office segment? In other words, is it a fairly cost intensive new product that we should keep in mind? And also, could it pull along Azure in the sense that you need Azure AD and perhaps some of the other cybersecurity products? A little color there might help everybody with their modeling exercise tonight and in the coming weeks."

In Office 365 Commercial, with you guys approaching 400 million seats and the E5 business really starting to accelerate here on that consolidated sort of expense ROI that you’re putting forth, should we think about the growth they’re more evenly balanced between seats and ARPU, going forward, or are we still to continue to favor seats?"

Is that also true for the soft guidance for 10% plus total revenue growth for the year? And if I could just sneak in a clarification, Amy, just because it’s an important metric, when you talk about a 4-to-5 point decel in Azure, that’s off of the 38% reported for December, right, not off the 35% exit rate? Thank you."
