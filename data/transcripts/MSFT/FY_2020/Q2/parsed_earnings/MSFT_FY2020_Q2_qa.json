          "content": "Our approach has always been to support our customers during their most acute needs without focusing solely on immediate revenue impacts. We are in a phase where businesses require remote operations, leading to increased demand for services like Teams, remote desktop, and security solutions. As we transition into recovery, hybrid work models will persist, enhancing the value of our architectural strengths. Additionally, structural changes such as the adoption of telemedicine and digital twins will create new opportunities for productivity growth."

          "topic": "Intelligent Cloud Business and Hybrid Engagements",
          "content": "Our commercial bookings growth has reached 25% on a constant currency basis, driven by larger, long-term Azure contracts. This growth is part of a broad-based trend across various industries, including those traditionally slow to adopt the cloud. The shift towards strategic partnerships and digital transformation initiatives with our customers contributes to this sustained and diversified growth. Hybrid engagements are effectively rolling out with larger customers, allowing seamless integration of on-premise and cloud assets."

          "topic": "Azure Gross Margins and Cost Structure",
          "content": "Azure gross margins continue to improve due to faster revenue growth compared to capital expenditures. Structural improvements in cost per unit and a shift towards premium services are key drivers. Our five-year roadmap for gross margin enhancement is on track, with Azure benefiting from these factors. Although the rate of margin improvement may slow as the revenue mix shifts towards IaaS and PaaS, the overall trend remains positive."

          "topic": "Durability of Server & Tools Growth",
          "content": "The 14% growth in Server & Tools is supported by durable trends such as our hybrid value proposition and premium mix. While there was some pull-forward demand due to SQL Server and Windows Server expirations, the underlying drivers like hybrid licensing and premium services ensure that growth remains robust over time. This durability is reflected in our continued investment in infrastructure and our ability to effectively meet customer needs."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Azure Gross Margins Improvement Drivers",
          "content": "The improvement in Azure gross margins is driven by revenue growth outpacing capital expenditure growth, structural cost improvements, and a shift towards higher-margin premium services. These factors have enabled significant gross margin enhancements without relying on one-time benefits. Moving forward, Azure gross margins will continue to benefit from these structural improvements, even as the rate of margin growth moderates."

        {
          "topic": "Windows OEM Revenue and Migration Tailwind",
          "content": "Windows OEM revenue is sustained by continued low inventory levels due to ongoing chip supply constraints. The tailwind from the Win7/Win10 migration is expected to extend for a few more quarters, particularly as small and medium businesses continue their transitions. In the volume licensing and commercial segments, we see double-digit billings and strong demand driven by our Microsoft 365 value proposition, which helps offset any short-term fluctuations in OEM revenue."

          "topic": "Dynamics 365 Growth Drivers",
          "content": "Dynamics 365 has grown to over $2 billion, surpassing our on-premises business. This growth is driven by our modular and modern business process applications, AI-first modules, and a disruptive business model that enhances competitiveness. The integration of AI and the development of new business applications without direct competition further accelerate Dynamics 365's growth. We continue to see significant opportunities in business process automation, positioning Dynamics 365 for sustained expansion."

          "topic": "Commercial Cloud Gross Margin Sustainability",
          "content": "Commercial cloud gross margins have improved by 200 basis points sequentially and 600 basis points year-over-year to 65%. This improvement is sustainable due to ongoing structural improvements, cost per unit reductions, and a shift towards higher-margin premium services. As Azure continues to grow and consumption-based services expand, we expect gross margins to continue improving, although the rate of improvement may moderate as revenue mixes shift towards IaaS and PaaS."

        {
          "topic": "On-Premise Software Growth Drivers",
          "content": "The growth in our on-premise software business is driven by our hybrid value proposition and premium mix. Customers value the flexibility to deploy workloads either on-premise or in the cloud based on their needs. Approximately one-third of our Windows and SQL Server customers are utilizing hybrid rights, which allows them to optimize their deployments and maintain flexibility. This trend is durable and supports continued growth in our on-premise business."

        "When I look at your next quarter guidance by revenue segment, it seems to imply overall revenue growth of about 9 to 10 percent. Combining that with the 14 percent growth in Server & Tools this quarter, it suggests that overall Microsoft revenue growth should remain roughly in the 10 percent range in the second half to achieve double-digit growth for the full year, despite moving past key end-of-support milestones. What are the key drivers that enable you to sustain that growth rate in the second half, and does your guidance account for any deterioration in the overall spending environment?"
