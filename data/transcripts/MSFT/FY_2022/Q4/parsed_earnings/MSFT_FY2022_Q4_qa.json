Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got that done? Was the consolidating impact that Microsoft brings to the market, the price performance, maybe the macro, is that actually a benefit for you guys to close these deals in this type of environment, or was it just kind of a typical Q4 end of year kind of budget flush kind of thing for you guys, and it was absent of the environment or not really related to the environment?"

        "Amy, you called out some transactional weakness, which in the March quarter, we can see in the on-prem Office segment. And in your guidance in the server product segment, you suggest we might see it there, too. Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific, as you described in your comments, or transitioning customers off your open license program, or do you feel like that’s a broader issue where maybe we’re starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we’ve seen before? Thank you."

        "Amy, I just wanted to focus in on your comments about capital spending, but also just utilization within Azure and obviously, some of the supply chain issues as mentioned before. What is the sense of sort of where utilization stands for around Azure and as you think about sort of demand trends relative to supply chain. How are you feeling about sort of where capacity stands right now? And is this actually driving any changes in your customer behavior, whether it be increased focus on reserved instances, etcetera? That’d be great, thank you."

        "Amy, you noted a couple times just seeing some weakness in more the small business segment. Can you just talk about what’s going on there? Is that an opportunity for you all to go in and try to sell or more bundles and your suite? I guess how much of a drag has that been and do you see it getting better or worse? So just if you could just add a little bit more color on that part of your business, it’d be helpful. Thank you."

      "questions": [
        "Do you feel as though clearly the guidance, I think, has a very confident posture. When you think about your visibility into those consumption dynamics, is it that you’re seeing customers optimize their spend? Are you seeing them commit to longer duration contracts? And therefore, you’ve kind of see the different linearity of that consumption pace? And then if you think about it on a global basis, are there any different patterns domestically versus internationally in those moderating projects starts, or just general optimization conversations?"
