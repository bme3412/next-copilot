        "I wanted to ask you guys a high-level question about the overall demand environment and whether we’ve seen any changes, given sort of the disruptions we’ve seen from Omicron and a lot of what’s going on in the environment. There’s been a narrative among software investors and a lot of time the asset prices seem the narrative. I wanted to check in with you guys on how you feel about the overall demand environment, particularly around digital transformation and how durable is that going to be into calendar year ‘22? Do you still see a lot of wood to chop, if you will, a lot of activity taking place in that direction. Thank you."

        "Amy, commercial bookings up 14% is impressive, but it’s slowed down from last quarter’s 25 against a more difficult comp. I think you’d mentioned some color around Azure, and the size and duration. Can you just, maybe anything else you would call out there? I realize it’s coming off the tough comps."

        "Amy, heading into this Q1 release, I’d say there was a higher than normal level of worry from investors about your Windows PC segments, in light of all of the unit shipment and supply chain issues. And yet, you put up a Windows OEM number that blew away your guidance. And your guidance for the Windows OEM business in December was also, I think, way above what people are modeling. I guess, in essence, how did you dodge that bullet? Amy, maybe you could unpack that OEM performance for us and your view into the second half of the fiscal year. Thank you."

And Satya, in your remarks, you discussed how digital is deflationary in an inflationary world. Can you give more color on how the shift to cloud and digital offset inflationary pressure beyond purely pricing? Thank you."

What does Microsoft have today that they’re positioned to be able to deliver to meet those requirements and what do you believe you might be lacking in the partner ecosystem to meet those requirements? Amy, with the hype cycle underway and increased industry interest in the metaverse, are you changing your investments to meet the potential opportunity?"

      "questions": [
        "Maybe I wanted to ask a little bit philosophically, Satya. The pandemic clearly accelerated everyone’s timeline to migrate to the cloud, even if there wasn’t necessarily a big pull forward there. As we think about a post-Omicron world where there is some level of office re-openings and visibility into that, how should we think about the potential to see maybe another wave or another acceleration of those cloud migrations with that ability to have in office and have hybrid work? Maybe walk us through that. Thank you."

But as we look going forward, have you seen any early indications that customers are potentially having to slow down the pace at which they move to your commercial cloud? Thanks."
