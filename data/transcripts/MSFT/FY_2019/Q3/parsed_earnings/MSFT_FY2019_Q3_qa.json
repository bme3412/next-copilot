          "content": "Our commercial bookings growth has reached an all-time high on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in larger, long-term Azure contracts. This growth is not limited to a handful of customers but is part of a broad-based trend across various industries, including those traditionally slow to move to the cloud. The shift towards partnership relationships with customers is contributing to this sustained growth, although it introduces some volatility as these large contracts land."

          "topic": "Azure Gross Margins and Cost Structure",
          "content": "Azure gross margins have continued to improve significantly. We've achieved this through software and hardware innovation, optimizing our supply chain, and increasing the use of premium services. The ratio of fixed versus variable costs in Azure remains relatively stable, with depreciation and fixed costs constituting about 40%. While we've made remarkable progress in efficiency, there is still room for further improvement, particularly through premium workload usage and continued hardware and software optimizations."

          "topic": "Transactional Weakness and OEM Impact",
          "content": "The transactional weakness observed this quarter was primarily due to OEM impacts from chip supply constraints and secondary impacts from the PC environment affecting Office Consumer revenue. We have addressed the execution challenges and expect these issues to be resolved in the second half of the year. Overall, our transactional execution remained in line with expectations, with Office Commercial showing reasonable performance despite some headwinds."

          "topic": "Windows OEM Revenue and Commercial Growth",
          "content": "On the OEM side, we anticipate continued low inventory levels due to ongoing chip supply constraints, which should sustain our Windows OEM revenue performance. In the commercial segment, despite tougher comparables, the demand for Windows 10 Pro driven by corporate refresh cycles remains strong. The security and manageability features of Windows 10 continue to drive growth in the commercial market, offsetting some of the challenges with larger comparables."

The distinction between commercial bookings and unearned revenue has become more pronounced, with larger contracts contributing directly to Azure revenue growth as they are utilized."
