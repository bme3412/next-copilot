          "content": "Sure. That's easy, John. It was actually something very, very simple. First of all, outside of North America, our license was up, up quite a bit, in fact, internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the sales force. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech sales force between selling cloud; a group selling cloud and a group selling new licenses. So the group selling new license was a new group and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only weakness we had, and it was simply just a slow start as we reorg-ed the North America tech sales force since we split it. So there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue, and of course, the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference, and so they just kind of outsized. But no, we don't see anything and that's really all it was."

          "content": "Well, first, I'd like to thank you for noticing the amazing close we did on Fusion Financials, and we actually -- I got to tell you, the team, I think is pretty happy with this result and realize that all of our customers should be easily doing the same thing. So first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it.\n\nLet me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand, gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, OK? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual. Next quarter, you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down, and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections, so nothing to see here."

          "topic": "Database Options and Autonomous Database",
          "content": "Yeah, I think multi-tenancy, in memory, all of the database options that are used with the Autonomous Database, I think, are selling very, very well. Again, the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales, and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So people buy multi-tenant, they buy rack, they buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up, and they move them to the cloud.\n\nSo some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So our cloud sales force, in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again, we signed more than 500 deals, Autonomous Database deals, in Q1.\n\n3,700 new trials to 500 signed paying customers, more than, and we expect to double that in Q2. So we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator. And that will drive not only cloud revenue but also license revenue because of the options."

          "topic": "ERP Market Share and SAP Competition",
          "content": "Well, our approach -- I mean sometimes they're critical of Amazon. Sometimes, I'm just -- I try to learn from what they do. I mean they were the innovator in cloud, and I give them credit for that. And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past.\n\nWe have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land, start small, get in there on a project that demonstrates how great this technology is, and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects, have moved on to two more, moved on to -- and then moved on to 10 more after that.\n\nSo we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have four -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials or short of 4,000 trials, in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now, and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market.\n\nIt's another -- I mean so we're sitting in two markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data, you can actually see the curve and the curve's -- we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve, and you can do these market share studies. There are all these analysts' reports and all that, and we made great progress in that and you could see it.\n\nIn the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology, and we're so early on in the curve, we've got such little data in the curve. I understand -- and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's, I think, going to go Autonomous Database.\n\nBut it's not just that, it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those two markets, should be enough to make a living."

But also knowing Mark for years, I'm sure he'd like to sort of get back to business, so I'll move right to question here.\n\nSo there was -- Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but License was not as strong as we modeled it anyway, and I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter, and you said it follows the strongest and yes, really strong fourth quarter, as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line, any further color?\n\nFor instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction, right? And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like it used to? I mean it started to get a little more even. It's still seasonal but a little more even. So should we be starting to think of seasonality, how Oracle used to be even more seasonal or we're also hearing and you guys, you hear you too, you hear from some other companies that talk about macro pressure. Are you seeing any of that at all? I'm just curious, any color would be helpful."

But getting on with business, wanted to dig in a little bit to the great momentum that you're seeing in cloud ERP? And you gave a lot of color, Larry, in your comments, but perhaps if you can help us understand what the demand patterns look like among existing customers migrating versus new logo business that you're able to attract. And as well, that market has always been a fragmented market. And is there any evidence that you might be benefiting from consolidation finally in ERP which has so many players that's in the long tail? Thank you."

And to the team, congrats on a solid start to the year. I just wanted to follow up on John's question on the database. One of the questions I get from investors is sort of the trajectory of database because, obviously, we're getting some metrics from you guys that's showing an inflection in terms of customers and also just trials out there. How do you think about just the, I guess, the shape of the curve of database growth going forward with all these different levers?"

Just wanted to ask two quick questions; one, if I could, Safra, I know John DiFucci asked some questions about the environment. You talked about the North American sales reorg. I was wondering just you've seen a lot of results since August, early August, come in where maybe results haven't been as good as people wanted.\n\nI'm just wondering if you're seeing -- if you saw any elongation in sales cycles, if there's anything you can share with us there just globally from what you've been seeing. And then secondly, just a question related to OCI and -- I know obviously, Open World's next week. There'll be a lot of partners to talk to. But a lot of the partners we've been speaking to of late have talked about a real pickup in momentum there. I'm just wondering if you can share with us what you're seeing. Thank you."

Larry, Safra, given autonomous adoption commentary, how good it's going, can you give us some more color based off this quarter on how the revenue lift is occurring as customers moving to the Autonomous Database based on what you're seeing in sales that is going now, how that's trending? And any sense to how think about -- to think about how large Autonomous Database revenue is, any color would be appreciated."

In theory, that should grow. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about why that declined this quarter? But then the bigger question was more for me around ERP. Larry, you talked about like you saw some medium-sized SAP customers starting to look. And is it -- kind of in terms of going bigger, is it kind of a question of functionality and capability or more around referenceability?\n\nBecause if I look at your -- you just deleveraged full quarter's numbers. You closed the quarter in 11, 12 days and were able to deliver that, which is kind of a record I've seen. And you guys are using Oracle Fusion. So it's really power -- it seems like a very powerful solution. So I'm just wondering what's holding it back at this point."
