We have a lot of orders for that that we have not deployed yet. So we've got a lot of demand there. We've got Autonomous Database, we've got new versions of Autonomous Database on track, we've got the entire Fusion Suite rolling, even including all of the additional modules, have all been continuously upgraded. So we've got immense amount of demand and we have enormous pipelines and our conversion rates are increasing. And so, the pipe has just expanded so dramatically than -- I know we're going to have more bookings, but also previous bookings as those deals are ramping up and more users are using the products. We are very, very upbeat about the second half, but even more so next year. We believe that the momentum we will have in the second half of this year will more than carry through to 2021."

          "content": "I generally feel very good about the Q3 License number. As you said, it is lumpy. The one thing we do have is that the GBUs, which are of course, not a giant part of our License business, but are significant. They have moved and their cloud products have become available. And I do expect that most of the orders for new services in the GBUs will come through as cloud services instead of just plain license. But I don't think that will be as significant. I do expect that licenses in fact will be just fine in Q3, other than GBU piece."

And I think there is nothing really special going on one way or the other. Sometimes it's just the way the quarter falls out for them. But overall, our business remains very strong and I think that next quarter could be completely different. So it was -- it's really nothing. We're not seeing a massive change, even month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter from what it's looked like. Obviously, there are some regions doing very, very well for a number of different reasons as they get to roll out new capabilities. We've got a lot of -- we've got data centers opening and have opened very, very successfully in Latin America, and in Asia and in Japan. And so we've got a lot of usage and increase in some of those areas, which help to explain some of the big growth in some of those areas. But EMEA, I think we'll see there is nothing special in particular. I have no real color to add and we'll see what happens after today's election in the UK."

          "content": "No. I mean there -- either in terms of the technological breakthrough. Well, yeah, I guess we had the first commercial relational database at the very beginning. I mean that's kind of created Oracle Corporation, right? So we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that created -- that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. So I would say Autonomous Database is that same kind of things. It is so much different, so much safer to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market. I think everyone is going to use it, virtually everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is -- it takes a while, when you introduce an all-new product. The good news is we’re having a huge installed base here, it takes a while for that -- for us to ship in, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year we've seen a lot of early adopters, but the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think eventually the only database we'll offer is Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else.\n\nAnd by the way, our Autonomous Database is only available in two forms. If we put a cloud in -- if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our Middleware machines and all of that's in our storage in your data center and in our public cloud. So we think it'll be consumed in one of those two ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business, from a financial standpoint, will more than double or triple, triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look at. Now, of course, when you're in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much we'll sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. Now, we don't have that many data points. We have four quarters of data points. And the first couple of quarters, it was still new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I’ve been saying is, none of us ever seen an adoption rate like this before."

But with the 3Q guide it does suggest a very strong fourth quarter on top of what was the fourth -- strong fourth quarter than last year. So can you give us a little bit of visibility into what's driving that confidence? And also, I know it's early, but given what that means for fourth quarter, what does that mean in terms of what it implies about fiscal '21?"

But I guess the first one, Safra, as you mentioned about license this quarter, it was a little lighter than what I think people were expecting. I know we're talking about a big base, but if there is anything you could call out in terms of whether it's the sales force reorg or just macro or whatever, in terms of the results in the quarter on that line? And then, I know just covering the company throughout, given the lumpiness historically between Q2 and Q3, I know sometimes deals push from one quarter to the next and typically it's better to just average those two quarters. But how do you feel about the outlook for the Q3 License number? And then I just have one follow-up if you don't mind?"

I mean, is there anything to share with us regarding you getting some -- you getting someone to kind of help take his place and some of the responsibilities that you've taken over?"

But having been in market now for over a year, I know investors are wondering when we might see an inflection in your financial results from Autonomous. And I appreciate many customers are including some of the required database option in their deals. But now that you're making it available on Gen2 Cloud at Customer, how should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials? And is there anything you might compare it to in Oracle's history?"

Obviously, we saw a nice pick back up here quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-over-year growth rate. I guess the question is Safra, and I guess Larry too, would you think about the sort of different curves that build up that business. Obviously, you've talked about in the past, some of the headwinds from things like Data Cloud and then also some of the wins that we saw on your Fusion -- Fusion ERP and NetSuite this quarter. Where are we, when we stack all those curves together? Are we past sort of those headwinds that we're now looking at sort of acceleration from here? In other words, Q1 was a trough or just help us kind of, Larry, take that up, if you could?"

I was wondering if you could just add a little bit color on sort of what you're seeing across the different theaters? Thanks."
