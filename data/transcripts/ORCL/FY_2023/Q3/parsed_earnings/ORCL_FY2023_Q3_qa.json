          "topic": "Organic Cloud Services Growth Drivers",
          "content": "So, let me tell you, it is all of the above, but let me tell you what's really happening down at each customer level. When customers try us for some reason, whether they're using Fusion and they start using OCI for their own applications or they hear really from word of mouth and from really a need to run some of their Oracle workloads or otherwise, when they give a try to Gen2 OCI or to Fusion for that matter, what they find is that it is phenomenal. Our Gen2 Cloud is so much better than what they're used to and is so much more flexible and can be much more local, gives them so many more opportunities to really match to their own needs, but they're overwhelmed by the technical capabilities of our cloud and how great it is. So, what happens is they may start small and then they accelerate in their consumption, and they sign larger and larger and more significant contracts.\n\nAs you see in our RPO, there's a lot already contracted, and that's without us adding a single additional customer or expanding the use. But we have, as I said, so much company-specific or product-specific momentum that as customers discover us, use us, give us a chance, they become honestly overwhelmed by our capabilities and how much less expensive, more flexible, more secure, and how differently we're architected such that we're also more sustainable for them. And so, it's just incredible company-specific, product-specific momentum, and nothing really has to happen for us to continue to do very, very well here. And whether they're trying to save costs or expand growth, we help them do that in an incredibly flexible way and super, super cost-competitive for them."

          "topic": "License Revenue Strength",
          "content": "So contrary to, I think, the fears the people always have, the Oracle database is still the biggest part of license by far. So, most important part, the database remains strong because customers understand that they can BYOL, bring your own license, and they can have coverage, whether they're on-premise, in the cloud, or moving in between the two. So, again, really always the big number. But we've got growth rates that are very strong in Analytics.\n\nWe have growth rates that are super strong in Java. We have growth rates that are strong in the Industries areas. Some of our Industries applications. And then -- so, I want to make sure I gave you the numbers both ways.\n\nWith Cerner, we have a growth rate of 23% because, of course, you had the Cerner license. Without Cerner, it's 9% growth. So, even without Cerner, we have license growth after a very strong growth rate a full year ago in license. So, again, big dog is, of course, technology.\n\nThat's the bulk of it. But we've got a few industry apps and a little bit of Cerner. And it just remains just super strong."

          "topic": "Cerner Integration and Cost Savings",
          "content": "Sure. So, Mark, we've owned Cerner for about five months. And I will tell you that they continue to do better than we had projected internally. So, we're very, very happy.\n\nBut we are still at the beginning. You know, we don't want to do anything that will damage the business. And, of course, we're very, very focused on those customers, but we are already having some level of savings. But ultimately, just so that you understand, our expectation is we will run them at typical Oracle margins.\n\nSo, we've got quite a way to go. And I think over the next couple of quarters, you'll see continued improvement as we've done some of our operational integration. And simultaneously, I think they continue to overperform for us. So, we are doing this in a very careful way so as not to put any issues for our customers and making sure they're successful."

          "topic": "OCI Go-to-Market Strategy",
          "content": "Yeah. Let me start, Larry. Go ahead.\n\nAnd answering for you on how is the Oracle database doing, well, you saw we had an amazing Q4. And in Q1, again, the Oracle database is what people choose if they have real work to do. It's very secure. It's very performant, and they know it has so many capabilities that you don't have to have 16 different databases to get a complicated job done.\n\nYou can do everything with it in different ways. And the database options continue to be acquired. Many more customers still want enterprise agreements so they can BYOL, bring your own license, to the Oracle Cloud. Our technology remains unbelievably strong with Java.\n\nAnd so, the business overall, our tech business remains incredibly strong, even though it's enormous and for many, many of the reasons. I think there was a period a few years back where folks were thinking they would try lots of other things and things that were maybe more 'fashionable.' I think they've realized that actually getting your job done securely, performantly, sustainably, and also really least expensive is to actually use our products to do that. And so, they've been doubling down and committing and bringing those workloads to the Oracle Cloud, again propelling just incredible momentum, whether it's Cloud at Customer, dedicated regions, or our public cloud."

        {
          "topic": "Cloud Growth Confidence and Data Center Capacity",
          "content": "Well, remember, as I told you, we have dropped a large number of data centers. And as they become available, we have customers waiting to get started and use them. So we have commitments from customers to quite an enormous amount of consumption. And so they've basically been waiting for us.\n\nWe've -- it's taken a while in all these different countries to open these data centers and to make them available to our customers. And so we know they are actually very impatient to use the capacity as it becomes available. And we just have a lot of momentum and a lot of commitment from our customers and a lot of enthusiasm around our offerings. And so this is -- that's how the math works."

          "topic": "OCI Cost Advantage",
          "content": "Well, maybe the most interesting thing is we have a much faster network than anybody else. We have a fundamentally different network than any of the other cloud providers. We have what's called an RDMA network that we had to build because our Exadata machines and our database actually glued together a lot of computers. And when you had a single database application that could run on one computer or it could run on a cluster of computers, two computers, four computers, eight computers, whatever, so that there was no single point of failure.\n\nOne of the beauties of the Oracle Database, one of the big differences between the Oracle Database and other databases is that the Oracle Database, a single application could run on multiple computers. If one of those computers would fail, the application would keep running. It was fault tolerant. It would tolerate a failure of a machine.\n\nOther people don't have that. But in order to do that, we had to make our network. You're going to have a cluster of four machines running a single database app. We have to make that network between those four machines very fast.\n\nAnd that's called an RDMA network. It means that one computer can immediately access the memory of another computer without going through an interrupt. It's a very fast way to interconnect computers and have them act as a group. We built that for our entire cloud so we could run our database, our Oracle Real Application Cluster database on any of the computers in our cloud.\n\nNow, because we built this hyper-fast network, it turns out it has more utility than just running the Oracle Database. So, if you're running a cluster of computers doing a simulation, a car crash simulation -- that was one of the first applications people noticed ran much faster on Oracle. And now, a much bigger application that has run much faster on Oracle was on neural networks and machine-learning workloads, run much faster on Oracle, so -- because our network is just intrinsically much faster and thereby there are also -- there are security and reliability advantages to go along with that. So, our networks configured, we actually have -- all of our computers actually have two networks.\n\nI'm not going to go into all the details. But our computers are fundamentally different than any other cloud company. We have two networks. One of which is on the internet -- or I should say, one of which interconnects all of our customers' computers.\n\nAnd the other, which is our, if you will, our control network, where our -- and computers that run our cloud control software, which is isolated from the customer's software. So, the customer can't tamper with our cloud control software. They can't get control of it. And we can't see the customers' data.\n\nThat is unique to Oracle. But the -- because we have the two networks and because one of the networks is RDMA, we just run much, much faster, much more reliably than they do. And it's a fundamental advantage that they can't compete with, unless they rebuild their cloud from scratch."

          "content": "Yeah, let me just add one thing, which is Safra addressed the issue of modernizing back office to save money. Let me tell you another way you can save money. We -- I personally have been talking to some of Amazon's most famous brands that are running at AWS.\n\nAnd the AWS build is getting very large, and they can save a huge amount of money by moving to OCI. And we, I expect next quarter, will be announcing some brands, some companies moving off of Amazon to OCI that will shock you. I'll stop there."

With the slowdown we're seeing across so many IaaS PaaS vendors over the last couple of quarters and especially this quarter, why has OCI Gen 2 held up so well? You have born in the cloud customers, which you're seeing weakness elsewhere, you have enterprises. Is it simply low price? Is it performance? Is it you're at the right time in the economic cycle to be capturing new customers? Is there some dynamics around expiry credits that you're -- that are driving this? The difference is too stark. I think it's really important.\n\nSo the more color you can give, the better. Thanks."

          "question_text": "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another strong quarter. And really, two metrics jumped out to me this quarter.\n\nFirst, with, you know, IaaS revenue accelerated to 59% from 58% and 39% the prior two quarters. And organic RPO growth also accelerated to 28%, which is pretty phenomenal this quarter, from 22 and 17 in the prior two quarters. Can you just give us sort of a breakdown of what's driving this continued strength compared to some of your cloud competitors in the past in the IaaS world that have experienced decelerating growth in recent months? And are there any workloads in particular that are driving the relative strength of OCI?"

          "question_text": "Hi, Safra and Larry. I'm a little surprised to see your strong results here when most software companies, other than some of the pure security names, really faltered some against the macro backdrop. And frankly, you just didn't hear. But I want to focus the question on one area that we've gotten the most questions on since we launched coverage, and that's on organic constant-currency cloud services growth.\n\nIt looks like you came in above the high end of your guidance for the quarter, and you reiterated, Safra, that you expect greater than 30% growth for the year, which doesn't seem like a stretch like it did when you gave that first. We understand the way a subscription model works but we obviously don't see everything that you see. Can you give us some more color around what's driving the results this quarter and what gave you the confidence in this outlook for cloud services? Was it previously contracted revenue that's just starting to ramp up? Was it expected increase in consumption or something else or all of the above?"
        },
        {
          "question_text": "Thank you. I think this question is for Safra. We've heard a lot about your committed cloud mega deals, but you sometimes have talked about pure consumption or pay-as-you-go deals. Other vendors that employ the pay-as-you-go model, such as Mongo and even Snowflake, to some extent, who had been getting a ton of traction in the market, have either seen or they anticipate dramatic slowdowns.\n\nWe haven't seen anything like that in your results at all and certainly not in your guidance. But can you talk about your exposure to such deals and how they're progressing?"

Safra, where are we on the Cerner integration process, as well as taking out the costs? And when do you think you can drive those long-term costs over time? And, Larry, we heard a lot of great futures at Oracle World about CERN and what you can do in healthcare.\n\nIt'd be interesting to hear what progress you've made recently. Thanks."

Larry, one area we've been doing more work on is how cloud vendors can help transform the telco market, including migrating their IT infrastructure and their network operations to the public cloud, which should lead to greater efficiencies and also give them a more effective platform to roll out new 5G and edge application services. I know you guys touched on this a bit at last year's Analyst Day, but I was just hoping to get an update on how you're thinking about that telco opportunity with the Oracle stack, especially with OCI? Who's some of the telco operators you're partnering with? And how you see this playing out over the next couple of years?"

Larry, as I think about the strong momentum in Cerner, expanding the contract base by $5 billion and your expectations for the business to accelerate, can you parse through the drivers in terms of new logo win rates versus the expansion and cross-sell you're doing with Fusion, for example? And then also, Larry, you touched on the idea of a single medical record. People have been talking about this for decades.\n\nWhen does it become clear that Oracle is helping improve the quality of care and saving lives?
