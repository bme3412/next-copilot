          "content": "So, let me tell you, it is all of the above, but let me tell you what's really happening down at each customer level. When customers try us for some reason, whether they're using Fusion and they start using OCI for their own applications or they hear really from word of mouth and from really a need to run some of their Oracle workloads or otherwise, when they give a try to Gen2 OCI or to Fusion for that matter, what they find is that it is phenomenal. Our Gen2 Cloud is so much better than what they're used to and is so much more flexible and can be much more local, gives them so many more opportunities to really match to their own needs, but they're overwhelmed by the technical capabilities of our cloud and how great it is. So, what happens is they may start small and then they accelerate in their consumption, and they sign larger and larger and more significant contracts.\n\nAs you see in our RPO, there's a lot already contracted, and that's without us adding a single additional customer or expanding the use. But we have, as I said, so much company-specific or product-specific momentum that as customers discover us, use us, give us a chance, they become honestly overwhelmed by our capabilities and how much less expensive, more flexible, more secure, and how differently we're architected such that we're also more sustainable for them. And so, it's just incredible company-specific, product-specific momentum, and nothing really has to happen for us to continue to do very, very well here. And whether they're trying to save costs or expand growth, we help them do that in an incredibly flexible way and super, super cost-competitive for them."

          "topic": "Unique Value Proposition of Oracle Infrastructure",
          "content": "Yeah. Let me just add one sentence to that. We are the only infrastructure company that builds enterprise-scale applications. As a result of building these enterprise-scale applications, we have made our infrastructure much, much better.\n\nSo, we not only provide infrastructure and sell infrastructure, we consume the infrastructure ourselves. I think that gives us certain insights as to what we need to build at the infrastructure layer to make our application secure, reliable, and so on and easy to use, and make people productive. That's why -- I think that's what a lot of customers are discovering when they come to our cloud, that they are more productive, that the system runs faster, it's more secure, it's easier to use, all of that. And that's what gives us confidence that we can build the next generation of healthcare application because we do both.\n\nWe do both applications, enterprise applications, and infrastructure, and we're the only one."

We -- I personally have been talking to some of Amazon's most famous brands that are running at AWS.\n\nAnd the AWS build is getting very large, and they can save a huge amount of money by moving to OCI. And we, I expect next quarter, will be announcing some brands, some companies moving off of Amazon to OCI that will shock you. I'll stop there."

          "question_text": "Hi, Safra and Larry. I'm a little surprised to see your strong results here when most software companies, other than some of the pure security names, really faltered some against the macro backdrop. And frankly, you just didn't hear. But I want to focus the question on one area that we've gotten the most questions on since we launched coverage, and that's on organic constant-currency cloud services growth.\n\nIt looks like you came in above the high end of your guidance for the quarter, and you reiterated, Safra, that you expect greater than 30% growth for the year, which doesn't seem like a stretch like it did when you gave that first. We understand the way a subscription model works but we obviously don't see everything that you see. Can you give us some more color around what's driving the results this quarter and what gave you the confidence in this outlook for cloud services? Was it previously contracted revenue that's just starting to ramp up? Was it expected increase in consumption or something else or all of the above?"

Congrats on another strong quarter of organic growth.\n\nNow, obviously, Oracle has been delivering accelerating growth in its infrastructure and database businesses for multiple quarters now. Safra, can you give us some more color on just what the drivers are behind this? And how sustainable they are, be it BYOL, database add-ons, Autonomous Database, etc.? And then a question for Larry. Obviously, the expanded partnership with Azure announced in July has received pretty universal positive feedback. And you just announced today that Oracle's MySQL HeatWave will be available on AWS.\n\nHow do you think about these multi-cloud partnerships impacting the already positive existing momentum in your database business going forward?"

          "question_text": "Thank you very much for taking the question, and congratulations on a strong quarter. Larry, Safra, historically, in increasingly difficult economic conditions, organizations focused on what drove revenue growth or immediate savings, and thus, products like Salesforce Automation or similar areas received funding while back-office projects were delayed. What is different this time, both from a ERP point of view and an HCM point of view? What's going to drive the sustained growth and strength that you're expecting in Oracle's strategic back office? Thank you."

I was hoping to get an update on your go-to-market strategy for OCI.\n\nI mean, it's clearly becoming a more critical growth driver for you guys. Is there a dedicated sales force? Are you doing more bundling of OCI with other offerings? Just hoping to get an update on how you're going to market and what kind of resources you're putting around OCI because with 58% growth, it certainly seems like you're now gaining share in the cloud infrastructure market and it's a big market to go after. So, any color on that would be helpful."

Larry, we've heard of some very exciting things happening with Cerner pretty quickly after the deal just closed, with some hospital networks we heard from significantly expanding their existing contracts.\n\nCan you talk about the unique value you're able to deliver now that Cerner is a part of Oracle and the broader expansion opportunity that you see ahead? And if I could just sneak in one for you as well, Safra. $1.7 billion in capex in Q1 is a pretty big number. And I know very well that you don't spend frivolously. What can you tell us about the big step-up here?"
