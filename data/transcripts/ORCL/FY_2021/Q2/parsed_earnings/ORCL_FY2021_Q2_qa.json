          "content": "Raimo, maybe I'll start and then Larry can add in. I think that one of the things that has become incredibly obvious during this pandemic is that companies that have closer digital relationships with their customers, their employees, and their suppliers are doing much better than those that don't. And the work from home and all the data that -- capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you have that implemented your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud. And also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID.\n\nAnd there's no question that digital transformation is the top goal of companies and those companies that had been delaying or moving slowly have brand-new urgency on it. And of course, because we are ranked, and I think it's our third year in a row, in the top right-hand quadrant of Gartner, really with no one even close to us, we are the No. 1 choice of -- for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office applications. So for us, I have to say that there's just incredible, incredible momentum and commitment from our -- from prospects and customers and for companies who have been on-premise, either with our products or historically with SAP, where they just can't continue like they did."

          "content": "There is no question, we can support our dividend with the ease, OK. And any kind of increased dividend, we could support that also. I mean our business is very strong, as it's obvious. It generates very large amounts of cash, we believe, as you can tell, I'm not going to comment on future buybacks, but obviously you can tell, we have been buying back our stock, we think it's an incredible deal. It's basically gone on clearance sale in the past few days and we think it's an enormous, it's a fantastic investment and it reduces the number of outstanding shares or otherwise known as partners we have to share our very good profits with.\n\nSo, our business has hit an obvious inflection. I mentioned that it would accelerate in the second half. I never would have imagined that we would have the kind of reaction worldwide by companies and governments. So, I really, I've done my best at modeling what Q4 will look like to the extent that next year if this stabilizes, I believe we will be just continuing on in our -- we've changed our model and it's becoming obvious. So, I think our stock is obviously a bargain. It was a bargain before, and we are authorized to buyback, and we will let you know after we have done it."

          "topic": "OCI Success and Cloud Infrastructure Impact",
          "content": "Well, I think what we're seeing is now that some people are actually trying -- the people, the first group of people that are coming to OCI are people who are in the business of providing their application. I mean, it's great we have Verizon. We have end user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where there -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud.\n\nNot everyone believes, in fact, most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest cost cloud, but when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out and you're just seeing the beginning of that happening and I think a bunch of people were shocked in that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle and we were faster, much faster and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, hey AWS is bigger, so they must be better. Azure is bigger, so they must be better. Once they look, we win.\n\nAnd I think as far as our end-users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried out their clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in, we've got to get them looking, we've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS and we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our infrastructure cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth."

          "topic": "Autonomous Database Unique Advantages and Competitor Comparison",
          "content": "Yeah, well again, this is back to the maturity of our product. The combination of -- we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases. So we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do demonstrations against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, I don't think they have a better UI and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle, and not Alexa, you say, Oracle, how many vacation days, do I have. Oracle, I would like to schedule a one-week vacation starting August 17. And that, so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday.\n\nThe biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud, and security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment.\n\nAnd finally, we have a very, very broad suite, where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. It is very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult, finally for SAP to do that, because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So, we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We are doing very well, very, very well against all of our application competitors in the back office, in HCM, in ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce, though they are -- but they are a very formidable competitor in the front office, that's a different competitive dynamic."

On your Q4 call, you talked about what was going on under the hood of your constant currency revenue growth, and you mentioned that the growing businesses were growing at a 30% CAGR, the declining businesses at about a double-digit decline and the stable ones were up 1 to 2%.\n\nI'm just wondering, taking a look today and kind of how you're thinking about the future, how is the pandemic changing these growth rates, if at all, especially as OCI and things like cloud at customer become even bigger areas of focus for customers?"

I know you appreciate there are generational aspects to IT where, most often, the winner in the last generation isn't the winner in the next.\n\nBut under your leadership and vision and Safra's operational discipline, Oracle has been an industry leader for over four decades by thinking strategically about the future. And today, we hear amazing feedback on Oracle's latest innovations, the actual underlying technology like OCI and Autonomous. And by that alone, it would seem the future is bright for Oracle. But we've also seen in the past that the best technology doesn't always win.\n\nWhat gives you confidence that Oracle can remain successful and appeal to a younger generation, many who think cloud-first and want to move really, really fast?"

Can you elaborate a little bit on what trends you're seeing in application software?

Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in terms of people wanting to do, now that they're coming out of the pandemic, more around digital transformation; and hence, you had actually an extra boost on demand despite what you saw already beforehand?
