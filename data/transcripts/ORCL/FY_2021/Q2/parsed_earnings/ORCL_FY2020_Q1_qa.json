            "content": "Our approach has always been about this distributed computing fabric, viewing hybrid not as a transitory phase but as a long-term vision for how computing will meet real-world needs. Compute will migrate to wherever data is generated, increasingly at the edge. Hybrid benefits are driving Azure choices, and we're gaining market share with our competitive data center products. Architecturally, we feel well-positioned, as discussed at our Ignite conference, to support our customers' distributed computing needs."

With our business model that includes Game Pass and game streaming, we leverage our cloud infrastructure to enhance gaming experiences. The synergy between gaming and the rest of our business is significant, as the same Azure infrastructure supports gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. This integration allows us to optimize our resources and drive innovation across all platforms."

            "content": "Teams has had an explosive breakout year, surpassing previous platform effects like SharePoint. It serves as a comprehensive tool for communications, collaboration, and business processes. Teams is not limited to knowledge workers; it also provides significant value to first-line workers in various industries. The integration of security, compliance, and governance with Teams makes it a preferred choice for enterprise customers, enhancing their productivity and reducing security risks."

            "content": "Our commercial bookings growth has reached unprecedented levels on a constant currency basis, driven by larger, long-term Azure contracts. This growth is not concentrated among a few customers but is part of a broad-based trend across various industries, including those traditionally slow to adopt the cloud. The shift towards strategic partnerships and digital transformation initiatives with our customers contributes to this sustained and diversified growth."

            "topic": "Azure Gross Margins and Cost Structure",
            "content": "Azure gross margins have continued to improve through software and hardware innovations, supply chain optimizations, and increased usage of premium services. The ratio of fixed versus variable costs remains relatively stable, with depreciation and fixed costs accounting for approximately 40%. While there is still room for margin improvement, our focus on efficiency and premium workload adoption supports ongoing gross margin expansion."

            "topic": "Durability of Server & Tools Growth",
            "content": "The durability of our Server & Tools growth is supported by sustainable trends such as our hybrid value proposition and premium mix. While there was a pull-forward of demand due to SQL Server and Windows Server expirations, the underlying drivers like hybrid licensing and premium services ensure that the growth remains robust over time. This durability is reflected in our continued investment in infrastructure and our ability to meet customer needs effectively."

          {
            "topic": "Azure Gross Margins Improvement Drivers",
            "content": "Our commercial cloud gross margin improvement is driven by faster revenue growth compared to capital expenditure growth, structural improvements in cost per unit, and a shift towards premium services. This includes selling more SaaS-like services and consumption-based services that offer higher margins. Our five-year roadmap for gross margin improvement is on track, with Azure gross margins continuing to benefit from these factors."

            "content": "On the OEM side, we anticipate continued low inventory levels due to ongoing chip supply constraints, which should sustain our Windows OEM revenue performance. The tailwind from the Win7/Win10 migration is expected to extend for a few more quarters, particularly as small and medium businesses continue their transitions. In the volume licensing and commercial segments, we see double-digit billings and strong demand driven by our Microsoft 365 value proposition."

This growth is driven by our modular and modern business process applications, AI-first modules, and a disruptive business model that enhances competitiveness. The integration of AI and the development of new business applications without direct competition further accelerate Dynamics 365's growth. We continue to see significant opportunities in business process automation, positioning Dynamics 365 for sustained expansion."

            "content": "Commercial cloud gross margins have improved by 200 basis points sequentially and 600 basis points year-over-year to 65%. This improvement is sustainable due to ongoing structural improvements, cost per unit reductions, and a shift towards higher-margin premium services. As Azure continues to grow and consumption-based services expand, we expect gross margins to continue improving, although the rate of improvement may moderate as revenue mixes shift."
