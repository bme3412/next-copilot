It was an incredible Q4, and Q1 looks enormous.\n\nSo imagine, bookings are way up, and there's just a lot of success. We have so many customers that have gone live. So we have references from some of the largest companies in the world to really small or medium-sized companies that it's pretty consistent. Almost any prospect can find many companies just like it already being incredibly successful.\n\nAnd I think that, frankly, the pandemic taught many of our prospects and customers that moving quickly is really required these days. I think that folks used to think moving quickly is risky. I think they really saw that they had to move to much more modern, flexible, digital businesses, and that we are the [Audio gap] destination for them for the back office without a doubt."

          "content": "Yeah. The -- this is Larry. There are more new customers than upgrades from on-premise ERP with Oracle Fusion. So it's probably about 60-40 or in the 60s -- 40 -- it's probably not quite two to one new customers.\n\nBut most of the -- a majority of the business is coming from new customers. We're also upgrading our install base of the E-Business Suite, and PeopleSoft, and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customer [Audio gap] customers and for customers, people like, that are coming from our installed -- our on-premise installed base. So that's really the trend.\n\nAnd we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomena is relatively recent in the last 12 months. Over the last two years, but is really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So we think that's going to hold. So another way to look at it is I -- it's a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses.\n\nFusion ERP, it is certainly much bigger than 10 billion, and NetSuite is bigger than 10 billion [Audio gap] probably bigger than 20 billion as these businesses mature."

So I mean, everything else -- I mean, the database, you understand.\n\nThey're lifting and shifting existing database workloads and developing new Oracle database workloads on OCI. The other thing varies from things like Zoom who've moved over. But also in simulations. And we're very, very good at running simulation software.\n\nSo almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their PaaS simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. So we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads, running on -- running in OCI, and the other half is a variety of new customers, doing new applications not database-related."

But we'll be fine in Q4. Again, autonomous database is growing pretty rapidly. But we expect it really to explode next year, and I really do mean very, very rapid growth next year.\n\nI'm not really ready to disclose our plans as to why I think it's going to suddenly spike, but we expect very, very rapid database growth next year."

          "content": "Yeah. Well, we started 10 years ago to build Fusion Financials for the cloud, to rewrite all -- we have PeopleSoft ERP, JD Edwards ERP and of course, Oracle E-Business Suite. We had these three separate on-premise ERP systems because -- and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that for the cloud. And SAP, unbelievably, they just -- and by the way, we did a very good job. We started a decade ago.\n\nAnd we did, I think, a very good job redoing -- a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud. That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur.\n\nThey bought Ariba. They bought SuccessFactors. But they never -- and we made some acquisitions also, by the way. We bought Taleo and other things.\n\nBut we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database.\n\nAnd the thing we're competing with, so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, that's what SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP -- this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java, and it's entirely rewritten over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old, the same stuff that they've always had that they now will host for you.\n\nSo I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud. SAP just entirely missed the boat. So, SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. Again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud.\n\nIt's unbelievable what's happened, and their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works.\n\nYou're on the cloud. You get new features and functions. You're on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days.\n\nSAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It's simply is, OK, you can get the old -- you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud.\n\nThat's what happened. It's amazing."

Can you give us some more sense of how much of Oracle Fusion ERP is from new Oracle ERP customers? How much is international versus the U.S.? How much is large enterprise? Where's the sweet spot? Any color you can give to get a sense of what's really driving the growth and how much of that is new to versus existing customers would be very helpful."

And frankly, nice to see the stock starting to reflect the durability of earnings growth you guys have seen over the past couple of years. So it's nice to see that.\n\nI wanted to dig in a little bit on the infrastructure side of the equation, and in particular, OCI. Another quarter of at least 103% growth in OCI consumption. Can you dig in a little bit on sort of what are the workloads that are being done on OCI? Is this just all Oracle database workloads? We know there's a lot of those out there that just run so well on OCI. Or is there a broader perspective of the big workloads that guys are bringing over? Not looking for commentary on any specific customer, but just broadly, what do you see in that space? Where do you guys do well? Where do you win with OCI?"

It was up 4% as reported, flat constant currency off of what was actually the toughest comp for this fiscal year.\n\nI wonder if you can provide some context on sort of what is driving that, particularly sort of relative to the strength that you're also seeing in the cloud side? Is this Oracle database? Is this the add-ons to the Oracle database? Any sort of more color there and then also, in particular, sort of in conjunction with the cloud? That would be great."

Larry, it's so great to hear every single one of those SAP wins, especially since investors think of SAP's customer relationships as being so deep. So, clearly, by displacing them in so many accounts, it speaks volumes to the quality of your product and trust that these companies place with Oracle.\n\nSo, my question is this, why now and why from a product perspective? You mentioned Gartner's take. But since Oracle has always competed on having better product, what have you been doing product-wise that's enabled you to pull ahead of them like this? And what do you need to continue to do product-wise to remain ahead?"
