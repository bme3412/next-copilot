So first of all, I want to remind you that that -- remember that third leg of the stool I mentioned, which is our database and autonomous database, that is also part of OCI. And that is beginning to really expand.\n\nAnd our multi-cloud agreements, again, will help OCI gross margins so that you know gross margins even this quarter as the percentage increased, regardless of the fact that we have a lot more OCI, and so our business is really only now starting to get real scale. And we have built OCI in a way and Larry can really expand on it, where it is extremely automated. The management of it is very automated. And our whole rollout as it grows, we make more money.\n\nAnd as much as percentages are great, and again, our operating margin percentages continue to increase. and OCI includes not only base storage and compute and GPUs, but it also includes a lot of other capabilities, including the database, which have excellent margins, too. And of course, as you mentioned, our SaaS business, again, an excellent and at-scale business, even that business benefits from our expansion in OCI. And once again, even at its high margins continued to improve this past quarter.\n\nLarry, I don't know if you want to."

          "topic": "SaaS and Autonomous Database",
          "content": "I'd like to. So let's start with SaaS. As we go to Autonomous database, we get tremendous efficiencies. We're moving Fusion and NetSuite to Autonomous database as we speak.\n\nWe've decided everything needs to move to autonomous for two reasons really. First reason, when you have a completely autonomous database, there is no -- the DBA, the database administrator is a robot. There is no human labor associated with managing the Oracle Autonomous Database. Now OK, that's obviously a cost savings.\n\nBut more importantly, with no human labor, there's no human error. It's a huge security advantage we have over our competitors. There's no mistakes to be made. There's no human labor.\n\nIt's all automated. And the potential -- when you have everything completely automated, and it's also truly elastic. I'm not going to go into exactly what that means. But it means that you've got a running that certainly needs 500 microprocessors, you get those 500 for the three minutes you need it, and then you return them to the pool.\n\nSo that's very different than how other databases work, which they may call -- the cloud itself may be elastic in places, but their databases are typically not elastic. Autonomous is. So we use a lot less hardware. It's a lot faster.\n\nIt's a lot more efficient. It's fully automated, no human labor, much more secure. And the margins for the autonomous database business is much higher or much higher than the traditional Oracle business. And I think those margins are -- I mean, they're stunningly high.\n\nAround the same margins as a which are also stunningly hard margin because SaaS runs primarily on that autonomous database. So we use hardware very efficiently. We use labor sparingly because labor is a security risk. When people are actually doing things manually, it's a security risk, and it slows down our ability to expand.\n\nEvery Oracle data center from the largest to the smallest are identical in features and functions, they only vary by scale. That means we have one suite of automation software that automates all of this. Nobody else does this. No one has that level of automation, that level of autonomy.\n\nIt allows us to get much better margins in our database business and our SaaS business and the rest of our cloud business. Our clouds are more automated, so we have very low labor costs. Our networks are much more efficient, the RDMA networks run so much faster. If you run twice as fast, our costs go down by half.\n\nAnd our networks are much faster than the other clouds. So we think our potential as we scale our potential to deliver much better margins than we're currently delivering is very real."

          "topic": "Cost Savings and Automation",
          "content": "I believe so. And I believe, for example, I mean I think you'd find different points of view from different engineers as we move Fusion to Autonomous Database. I think the cost savings -- our cloud cost savings will be around 50%. That's what I believe.\n\nNow it might be 40%, it might be 35%, but there will be huge cost savings from where we are now, and that's across the entire base of Fusion customers. So that's just one example of how we're using faster networks, faster databases, more automation to make our products more secure. And I keep emphasizing that security is really the primary goal. But as a second-order effect, we also end up spending a lot less money to run those data centers.\n\nJohn Difucci -- Analyst\n\nSo is it safe for me to assume that then the upside you keep putting up and you hopefully will continue to do, will add profit, and that profit will actually increase as a percentage of the margins will also increase over time?"

You keep putting up strong cloud numbers, especially the OCI numbers that look when you give the guidance and you look at what you have to do to hit them. They look really difficult to do, to say the least.\n\nWe also assume that upside to RPO. And you pointed out, Safra, the sequential increase. I think the last time there were sequential increases because you bought Cerner and it just added RPO because of that. I assume a big part of that OCI too.\n\nYou mentioned it's cloud, three-quarters of it. So that indicates there's more to come, right? So given the mix of business continuing to lean into that lower margin OCI, and I know you have that's changing over time, but it's still lower margin today. How should we think of overall margins versus profit for the entire company going forward?"

Or do you see the potential for high growth kind of all the way through both of these phases?"

You know, in talking to one of your GSI partners, we heard about a global public sector solution that they referred to as government in a box, where Oracle, in partnership with the likes of Starlink, the Tony Blair project, are building solutions on top of OCI, including apps and tech and even Cerner to literally run entire country's digital operations. So, hoping you can -- you can add even a little bit more color about what you're doing here, how big an opportunity it is, because it just seems like such a powerful example of the entire Oracle Cloud stack coming together in a very meaningful way."
