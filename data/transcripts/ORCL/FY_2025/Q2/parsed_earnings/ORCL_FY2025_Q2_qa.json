          "content": "OK. Let me start with this and maybe then Larry can add on. So first of all, I want to remind you that that -- remember that third leg of the stool I mentioned, which is our database and autonomous database, that is also part of OCI. And that is beginning to really expand.\n\nAnd our multi-cloud agreements, again, will help OCI gross margins so that you know gross margins even this quarter as the percentage increased, regardless of the fact that we have a lot more OCI, and so our business is really only now starting to get real scale. And we have built OCI in a way and Larry can really expand on it, where it is extremely automated. The management of it is very automated. And our whole rollout as it grows, we make more money.\n\nAnd as much as percentages are great, and again, our operating margin percentages continue to increase. and OCI includes not only base storage and compute and GPUs, but it also includes a lot of other capabilities, including the database, which have excellent margins, too. And of course, as you mentioned, our SaaS business, again, an excellent and at-scale business, even that business benefits from our expansion in OCI. And once again, even at its high margins continued to improve this past quarter.\n\nLarry, I don't know if you want to."

          "content": "Actually, I don't agree with you that folks aren't looking at their back office systems. In fact, I think there's an enormous amount of pressure to be more efficient for many companies. The competition is fierce in almost all industries right now. And as companies, when they look at us, for example, that's why I always point out that it's -- what is it? Day nine? And that includes three weekends -- three weekend days since our quarter closed.\n\nThat just shows how efficient you can be in running your operation. And a lot of company executives actually come up to me and say, \"We need to do that. We need to do more and spend a lot less doing it.\" And we see an enormous -- really enormous pipeline in customers who understand that they can, first, automate and simplify their own businesses to spend less so they can invest in the things that differentiate them. But there's also enormous interest in using their data for AI and using those systems.\n\nWe have, I don't know, dozens and dozens of AI agents that can really help companies spend a lot less and really do a better job serving their customers. So, we find enormous interest in this area. And no one has the capability and the data and the AI capability that Oracle can bring to a customer. So, actually, I think it's been one of the most exciting times in back office and in front office, too.\n\nWe have -- even our front office systems also taking advantage of so many of our capabilities for our customers. So, this has been a great time. And in fact, our booking trends, which you don't see yet in revenues because we wait until they're implemented, our booking trends have taken a marked step-up. We were going over those just today, and they've accelerated from last year quite significantly."

          "topic": "SaaS and Autonomous Database",
          "content": "I'd like to. So let's start with SaaS. As we go to Autonomous database, we get tremendous efficiencies. We're moving Fusion and NetSuite to Autonomous database as we speak.\n\nWe've decided everything needs to move to autonomous for two reasons really. First reason, when you have a completely autonomous database, there is no -- the DBA, the database administrator is a robot. There is no human labor associated with managing the Oracle Autonomous Database. Now OK, that's obviously a cost savings.\n\nBut more importantly, with no human labor, there's no human error. It's a huge security advantage we have over our competitors. There's no mistakes to be made. There's no human labor.\n\nIt's all automated. And the potential -- when you have everything completely automated, and it's also truly elastic. I'm not going to go into exactly what that means. But it means that you've got a running that certainly needs 500 microprocessors, you get those 500 for the three minutes you need it, and then you return them to the pool.\n\nSo that's very different than how other databases work, which they may call -- the cloud itself may be elastic in places, but their databases are typically not elastic. Autonomous is. So we use a lot less hardware. It's a lot faster.\n\nIt's a lot more efficient. It's fully automated, no human labor, much more secure. And the margins for the autonomous database business is much higher or much higher than the traditional Oracle business. And I think those margins are -- I mean, they're stunningly high.\n\nAround the same margins as a which are also stunningly hard margin because SaaS runs primarily on that autonomous database. So we use hardware very efficiently. We use labor sparingly because labor is a security risk. When people are actually doing things manually, it's a security risk, and it slows down our ability to expand.\n\nEvery Oracle data center from the largest to the smallest are identical in features and functions, they only vary by scale. That means we have one suite of automation software that automates all of this. Nobody else does this. No one has that level of automation, that level of autonomy.\n\nIt allows us to get much better margins in our database business and our SaaS business and the rest of our cloud business. Our clouds are more automated, so we have very low labor costs. Our networks are much more efficient, the RDMA networks run so much faster. If you run twice as fast, our costs go down by half.\n\nAnd our networks are much faster than the other clouds. So we think our potential as we scale our potential to deliver much better margins than we're currently delivering is very real."

          "topic": "Cost Savings and Automation",
          "content": "I believe so. And I believe, for example, I mean I think you'd find different points of view from different engineers as we move Fusion to Autonomous Database. I think the cost savings -- our cloud cost savings will be around 50%. That's what I believe.\n\nNow it might be 40%, it might be 35%, but there will be huge cost savings from where we are now, and that's across the entire base of Fusion customers. So that's just one example of how we're using faster networks, faster databases, more automation to make our products more secure. And I keep emphasizing that security is really the primary goal. But as a second-order effect, we also end up spending a lot less money to run those data centers.\n\nJohn Difucci -- Analyst\n\nSo is it safe for me to assume that then the upside you keep putting up and you hopefully will continue to do, will add profit, and that profit will actually increase as a percentage of the margins will also increase over time?"

          "topic": "AI Infrastructure and Network Efficiency",
          "content": "Well, there's two elements to speeding up training. One is building larger and larger GPU clusters made up of faster and faster GPUs. So, it's a GPU cluster itself. The second element, something Oracle has been very, very focused on, is building networks that rapidly move large volumes of data into those GPU clusters.\n\nAs you make these GPU clusters larger and faster, it's putting more and more demands on the network to be able to move huge amounts of data into those GPU clusters so that GPU clusters aren't sitting there waiting for the data. If they're sitting there waiting for the data, it becomes very inefficient. If you're paying by the minute and half the time, half of 30 seconds, you don't have the data available. Obviously, that's a scaling problem.\n\nAnd that's an economic problem, and that's a performance problem. Oracle differentiates itself in its data centers by investing heavily in building networks and, by the way, switch software, all sorts of network software and network hardware to move data more quickly. We think we'll be able -- the demand is really -- as the GPU clusters get bigger and faster, the demand -- the critical thing is for us to be able to move the data faster. And we are investing heavily in that, and we think we're going to maintain our advantage there.\n\nAnd that will -- as we make our networks faster, the AI training will get faster. If we don't -- if no one makes the networking faster, then I think there's a potential bottleneck. But we're trying to, you know, avoid that bottleneck by speeding up our networking."

It's been a while, but you've previously said that OCI gross margins have improved consistently.\n\nAnd I think you just mentioned it again in your prepared remarks. And I think the last time you actually threw out a number was a while ago, but it was in the low 30s for gross margins for OCI. And that was several quarters ago. Can you give us an update on the progress of that, especially given the massive growth you're seeing?"
