          "content": "John, the infrastructure-as-a-service growth of 49% implies a Herculean increase in new business coming online, new ARR, the way we model it anyway, something I just thought you wouldn't be able to do this quarter given -- given how much you had to do, though we realized we don't know the timing of when deals come online. But last quarter, you said you were going to reallocate resources to focus on some of these very large OCI deals to get them implemented earlier, so you start to get revenue earlier. Is that what happened this quarter? Is that what we're seeing, or is that still -- is that still to come?\n\nI honestly, John, that is still to come. So, this is just pretty much our regular-way business. That's what you're seeing. We have enormous amounts of demand.\n\nI tried to make that clear last quarter. And we have more capacity coming online, but we had tried to -- you know, we tried to focus on much larger chunks of data center capacity and electricity and all of that. And that's just -- that's all to come. This is really our regular-way business and our customers just growing. And a whole bunch of new customers, by the way, I think they're there are many many customers who have come on and -- that haven't gotten capacity yet.\n\nWe've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over a billion that haven't come online yet."

          "content": "Yes. And I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we showed you, even though I gave you more detail, is I showed you a number that is a mix of cloud and support. And obviously, support is extremely profitable because it -- because of the structure of the way it works and because we are at such a large scale.\n\nBut the reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS business -- our SaaS cloud business is very profitable. And our IaaS, our OCI business, is improving profitability as it grows. And so, the target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure-play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this.\n\nOur -- as we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up. So, yes, we make a lot of investments and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up because once the day -- the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day. But that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space, but we grow in pieces, unlike some of the others that they have to do a full-out build-out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue.\n\nThat's not how we work. We -- and more and more of our -- so we start small and build up, and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. And that's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that, you know, the first-generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that."

          "content": "Yeah. Well, again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned, we're going to sign two additional contracts right around a billion dollars each. I mean, the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the words Safra used, and that's accurate.\n\nThere's no reason why -- you know, OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger. And actually, the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online. We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly.\n\nBy the way, again, I emphasize, it's not just gen AI demand. There's huge pent-up data -- you know, cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds where people -- you know, governments haven't been able to move their workloads. And a lot of those are government Oracle workloads.\n\nThey haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud. I mean, there are literally, I don't know, five, six, seven large companies in Japan that will be building at least two data centers -- Oracle data centers each. So, again, the demand is extraordinary, we can build the data centers relatively fast, and I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years."

          "topic": "Data Gravity and AI Impact",
          "content": "Well, you know, you can't build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So, if anything, what -- what AI -- generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting -- that this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster, it is a huge data problem in a sense you need so much data to, you know, train OpenAI, to train ChatGPT 3.5. They read the entire public internet. They read all of it, Wikipedia, they read everything.\n\nThey ingested everything. And to specialize -- then you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records. Does it help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let's say. And we have partners imaging, for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models.\n\nWe have Ronin, another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn't work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So, in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravity to AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you had to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train -- to train image recognition.\n\nSo, we think this is very good for our database business. And Oracle's new vector database will contain highly specialized training data like electronic health records while keeping that data anonymized and private yet still training the specialized models that can -- that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases. So, we think it's a boon to our business, and we are now getting into the deep water of the information age. Nothing has changed about that.\n\nThe demands on data are getting stronger and more important."

          "topic": "OCI Architecture and Competitive Advantage",
          "content": "Well, again, our -- you know, we have -- we're on our second generation of data center and -- and our second generation of cloud. Now, a lot of people noticed that we were a little bit late to the party, but that's because we moved from a generation which we were not very happy with to a second generation, which we think solved a lot of problems that the other cloud companies have not yet solved. So, the non-blocking ultra-fast RDMA network is not only useful for AI -- training AI models; it's useful for almost everything. It's certainly useful for building a much faster database.\n\nIt's useful for -- in terms of the automation level we have in our data centers. Our data centers are 100% automated. They can figure themselves; they run themselves. We don't have a lot of labor now.\n\nThat -- that saves us a huge amount of money. A lot of labor costs is saved, but the biggest advantage is if you don't have human beings involved, you don't have human labor, you don't have human errors, you don't have mistakes, you can ensure security. Most security problems are caused by people that make mistakes or people that engage in mischief. We don't have that in our data center.\n\nThat's another huge advantage. Our data centers are -- because they're all -- they're identical, the only way we could automate them was to make them all the same. And they vary only by scale. There are big ones and small ones, but they're identical.\n\nThey all have the same hardware pieces and the same software pieces. They all have the same automation, and that automation allows us to put these data centers in very small countries. We expect to have many many more data centers than any other cloud provider, but we also put those data centers --- customers. Nomura Research, NRI, which resells Oracle Cloud capacity in Japan, has two dedicated regions and are building two more.\n\nThey run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I don't know of any clouds that are running stock exchanges other than ours. And again, it's because of the extreme reliability and security that we get with all of the automation that's included, you know, with our data center. So, we have cost advantages; we have performance advantages; we have security advantages.\n\nAnd that's why we're growing much faster than any of the other hyperscalers."

          "content": "Well, if you're -- you're constantly training these models. Keep in mind, you have to bring in new data if you're in -- obviously, in the healthcare field, in the legal field. New -- new cases are being judged. New research is being published all the time.\n\nAnd for your AI models to be relevant, they have to be up to date. So, it's not that you train and then do nothing but inferencing thereafter. So, your training and your inferencing sit right next to each other. As long as we can do this stuff twice as fast as everybody else, that's on the -- by the way, not just on the training side, that's also on the inferencing side, then we're going to be half the cost or better.\n\nSo, we think we're going to be very very competitive across the board, whether it's training or in inferencing. So, we don't -- so we're pretty confident that we've got a cost-performance advantage. Again, if you run twice as fast in the cloud, you cost half as much because you pay by the hour. So, the performance advantage is really an enormous cost advantage for us.\n\nWe don't see that going away anytime soon. And it applies to inferencing as well as -- as well as training. Now, as far as GPUs, is that our GPUs are a low-margin business, not for -- 100% automated cloud with very very low costs. We think, in some cases, our prices for GPU training, which are very profitable, by the way, for us but are often lower -- you know, our prices are lower than the costs of other hyperscalers doing the training.\n\nI think we're going to be very very competitive across the board, whether it's training or in inferencing. So, we don't -- so we're pretty confident that we've got a cost-performance advantage."
