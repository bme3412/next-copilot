And it's basically because of what I've been telling you all for a while, which is our fastest-growing business, which is our cloud, is now getting to be very big. And when you're growing different parts of the business, 25%, 30%, 40%, 60%, and it's a big number, it causes these -- it's just math here. It increases the overall rate of growth of the business."

          "content": "Well, I will admit that the past couple of years have been really challenging, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. I think, our excellent relationships with our wonderful suppliers made it possible for us to build out our cloud, as well as provide hardware to our customers. We couldn't meet every need as quickly as we would have liked, and we have an extremely large backlog. That is absolutely true.\n\nThat backlog also gives me enormous visibility because those customers have told us they want cloud at customer or they want hardware. And I have a line of sight to get it landed in their facilities. The reality is that we have so much going on at the same time. We've built out our cloud internationally.\n\nWe've built a number of private clouds where it is exactly the same capability as our public cloud for our customers who have regulatory requirements that require something special or whether it's data sovereignty or otherwise. And we are meeting everyone's needs. And I think, that, again, the incredible optimism you hear from me and Larry is very much because we have line of sight to the massive demand that has been coming our way and that we've been handling and a line of sight on how to deliver it. So now, I read the newspaper -- actually, I don't read the newspaper.\n\nI read the computer that used to be a newspaper. And so, we see everything that's going on. But I'm extremely confident in the capabilities of my team to execute."

          "topic": "Ecosystem Wins with OCI",
          "content": "Well, I think, it's broad-based. I think, one of -- the back office -- one of our partners -- we're working with one of the largest banks on the planet with -- on a payment system, a B2B payment system because the ERP customers are coming to Oracle. So if you look at the future with the fact that we're so strong, dominant, I'd argue, in cloud ERP, what does the B2B purchase look like? A B2B purchase looks like, in a modern cloud world, one Oracle ERP system making a purchase from another Oracle ERP system. And we want to automate that B2B transaction, that the two Oracle ERP systems are talking to one another.\n\nAnd to automate that transaction, we have to be able to pay for that -- we have to be able to check credit, finance the payments, arrange logistics. So we're working with a large -- a very large bank and a very large logistics company to automate that aspect of our ERP business. Some of it's never been -- you don't think of ERP doing that, but it's this network of these ERP systems talking to one another. That's a huge business revenue opportunity to turn on that B2B payment system.\n\nSo the banks are joining in. Logistic companies are joining in because the customers are here. Once the ERP customers started coming to Oracle, all of the adjacent applications and all the ISVs with adjacent applications wanted to be in the same cloud as the ERP customers. The integrators had to become familiar with the cloud because that's where the customers are, and that's where customers are going.\n\nThe ISVs. And these are kind of interesting ISVs. Giant banks, giant logistics companies putting up their logistics and payment systems in our cloud to facilitate B2B transactions between our ERP system is just a gigantic business opportunity that no one really ever thought about before."

But actually, it's -- this is -- at least for me, personally, this is a mission.\n\nI think, the benefits to every patient in the world is going to be enormous. We need to do this. The pandemic has shown a variety of weaknesses in our healthcare systems. We have the technology to address those weaknesses, and that's what we're going to do."

Can you talk to us about how you're winning the ecosystem with OCI? And as well, if you can update us on the mix of traditional versus nontraditional Oracle workloads. Just help us get a sense of how the use cases are evolving and where you see that mix going.\n\nThanks."

Larry, one for you on, on that success in the back office systems, like, is that driven by post-pandemic people realizing, 'Oh, shoot, I really need to update that.' So that's kind of more temporary boom that you're seeing here? Or do you think there's more legs to that? Thank you."

          "question_text": "Hey, before my question, congrats on another quarter of accelerating growth. One comment from your script today really stood out to me, and that was continued to grow profits while we push our top-line growth into the double digits next year. Now obviously, this is continued reacceleration from the 6% to 8% the past two quarters and your guidance, obviously, on a constant-currency basis for Q4. So my question to you, Safra and Larry is, can you help just unpack this for us in terms of the puts and takes between database and apps, cloud and on-premise, etc., that give you confidence for continued acceleration in the double digits, but also, like you said, while growing profits?"
        },
        {
          "question_text": "That's great. Well, that partially answers one of my questions. But when you think about that license and your example of their -- for example, like Salesforce, together with just the cloud services and the acceleration you see there, I mean, just that overall business seemed to accelerate during Q2 here and even versus Q1. And when I think about some of the other smaller competitors in the space, they've seen an acceleration as well.\n\nSo, I guess, Larry, my question is -- there seems to be something going on in the data world, the data infrastructure stack. And obviously, when Oracle moves at these -- at your scale at these percentages, there definitely seems to be something going on. So, what is that? And how do you think about the sustainability of those drivers?"

Oracle's dedicated regions seem to be reasonably unique offerings and a different spin on the hybrid cloud which the largest hyperscale providers are not offering. Can you explain how you're able to deliver this successfully and with good margins and why others cannot? And can you give us any sense of how large do you see that opportunity? Thanks."

And frankly, nice to see the stock starting to reflect the durability of earnings growth you guys have seen over the past couple of years. So it's nice to see that.\n\nI wanted to dig in a little bit on the infrastructure side of the equation, and in particular, OCI. Another quarter of at least 103% growth in OCI consumption. Can you dig in a little bit on sort of what are the workloads that are being done on OCI? Is this just all Oracle database workloads? We know there's a lot of those out there that just run so well on OCI. Or is there a broader perspective of the big workloads that guys are bringing over? Not looking for commentary on any specific customer, but just broadly, what do you see in that space? Where do you guys do well? Where do you win with OCI?"

          "question_text": "Last quarter, you guys talked a lot about an increasing focus on verticals, particularly banking and healthcare.\n\nThis quarter, you're talking about rolling up some of those verticals. Can you talk to us a little bit more about the approach on how you build up and create that roll up in the vertical? How much of that effort is building like vertical-specific products? How much of it is a new go-to-market strategy, if you will, or aligning the go-to-market strategy for those verticals? And how much work is left to be done on those two sides?"

How should we think about cloud at customer being somewhat of a leading indicator for adoption of Autonomous Database? And then, are any of the supply constraints starting to loosen up a bit on that front in terms of maybe helping to accelerate rev rec in that area over the next couple of quarters? Thanks."
