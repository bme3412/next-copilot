          "content": "Raimo, maybe I'll start and then Larry can add in. I think that one of the things that has become incredibly obvious during this pandemic is that companies that have closer digital relationships with their customers, their employees, and their suppliers are doing much better than those that don't. And the work from home and all the data that -- capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you have that implemented your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud. And also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID.\n\nAnd there's no question that digital transformation is the top goal of companies and those companies that had been delaying or moving slowly have brand-new urgency on it. And of course, because we are ranked, and I think it's our third year in a row, in the top right-hand quadrant of Gartner, really with no one even close to us, we are the No. 1 choice of -- for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office applications. So for us, I have to say that there's just incredible, incredible momentum and commitment from our -- from prospects and customers and for companies who have been on-premise, either with our products or historically with SAP, where they just can't continue like they did."

The RPO, I'm glad [Audio gap] really, really strong bookings are -- were truly enormous.\n\nObviously, they don't show up in the income statement right away, but they -- you know, the future is just so positive. And you might have heard me, I was hinting to that in my comments. And one of the reasons we're so comfortable leaning into our investment because we really want to make sure we've got the capacity to take on the enormous amount of bookings that are flying in. And that both were contracted and during the year and are going online, and so will be recognized over time -- over this next year and beyond.\n\nBut there is just an enormous backlog for us of customers that are going live and that will start consuming, and we're very optimistic. So thank you so much for asking and I'm glad you noticed that."

          "topic": "OCI Success and Cloud Infrastructure Impact",
          "content": "Yeah. The -- this is Larry. There are more new customers than upgrades from on-premise ERP with Oracle Fusion. So it's probably about 60-40 or in the 60s -- 40 -- it's probably not quite two to one new customers.\n\nBut most of the -- a majority of the business is coming from new customers. We're also upgrading our install base of the E-Business Suite, and PeopleSoft, and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customer [Audio gap] customers and for customers, people like, that are coming from our installed -- our on-premise installed base. So that's really the trend.\n\nAnd we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomena is relatively recent in the last 12 months. Over the last two years, but is really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So we think that's going to hold. So another way to look at it is I -- it's a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses.\n\nFusion ERP, it is certainly much bigger than 10 billion, and NetSuite is bigger than 10 billion [Audio gap] probably bigger than 20 billion as these businesses mature."

          "content": "OK. I mean, it's really easy to remember. About half of this database happened, then it's everything else. So I mean, everything else -- I mean, the database, you understand.\n\nThey're lifting and shifting existing database workloads and developing new Oracle database workloads on OCI. The other thing varies from things like Zoom who've moved over. But also in simulations. And we're very, very good at running simulation software.\n\nSo almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their PaaS simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. So we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads, running on -- running in OCI, and the other half is a variety of new customers, doing new applications not database-related."

          "topic": "SAP Replacement Wave and ERP Product Strengths",
          "content": "Yeah. Well, we started 10 years ago to build Fusion Financials for the cloud, to rewrite all -- we have PeopleSoft ERP, JD Edwards ERP and of course, Oracle E-Business Suite. We had these three separate on-premise ERP systems because -- and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that for the cloud. And SAP, unbelievably, they just -- and by the way, we did a very good job. We started a decade ago.\n\nAnd we did, I think, a very good job redoing -- a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud. That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur.\n\nThey bought Ariba. They bought SuccessFactors. But they never -- and we made some acquisitions also, by the way. We bought Taleo and other things.\n\nBut we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database.\n\nAnd the thing we're competing with, so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, that's what SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP -- this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java, and it's entirely rewritten over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old, the same stuff that they've always had that they now will host for you.\n\nSo I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud. SAP just entirely missed the boat. So, SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. Again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud.\n\nIt's unbelievable what's happened, and their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works.\n\nYou're on the cloud. You get new features and functions. You're on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days.\n\nSAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It's simply is, OK, you can get the old -- you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud.\n\nThat's what happened. It's amazing."

Safra, in the past, you've talked about the potential revenue opportunity for the app space if you were to migrate everybody to SaaS.\n\nSo I wanted to ask about the database side, and in particular, Exadata. Can you give us a sense of what the revenue potential or uplift could be if you shifted all Exadata customers to Cloud@Customer, and how you feel about the strength of those notions heading into the new fiscal year? And then for Larry, I mean, as you guys place to drive adoption of Autonomous Database, should we think of Cloud@Customer being the biggest vehicle for adoption, or what routes to market do you see working best?"

And within those customers, do you feel like you're taking wallet share versus some of the other public vendors just to give us a sense on how those might act as a proxy for others? Thanks."

Is this Oracle database? Is this the add-ons to the Oracle database? Any sort of more color there and then also, in particular, sort of in conjunction with the cloud? That would be great."

Larry, it's so great to hear every single one of those SAP wins, especially since investors think of SAP's customer relationships as being so deep. So, clearly, by displacing them in so many accounts, it speaks volumes to the quality of your product and trust that these companies place with Oracle.\n\nSo, my question is this, why now and why from a product perspective? You mentioned Gartner's take. But since Oracle has always competed on having better product, what have you been doing product-wise that's enabled you to pull ahead of them like this? And what do you need to continue to do product-wise to remain ahead?"
