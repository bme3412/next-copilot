          "content": "OK. So as you've seen, we've made a lot of investments. We basically -- our capex this year is double last year, and that's because we've been putting out a lot of capability around the world. Simultaneously, our revenues have been increasing.\n\nBut over the past few years, we've had parts of the business that were significant parts of the business that were shrinking. And now, as you see in this quarter, for example, all lines of businesses are increasing. We have different lines of business have bookings growth, some of which are as high as well over 100%. And so, what's happened is the -- most of the business is now growing.\n\nAnd so, they're much less of the negatives. And the things that we're getting smaller like application license, for example, is a very small number now. And then, of course, our technology license is going very, very well, including, just this quarter, technology was up 9%. So the cloud business is on an absolute role.\n\nYou can see it in the numbers already and ERP, HCM, but also, of course, OCI straight and Autonomous Database. And just all those parts of the business are now growing, and they're large. And the shrinking parts of the business -- first of all, there's a lot less shrinking. We grew, and to the extent that we have some supply chain loosening where we are able to deliver all of our bookings, we just expect growth sort of all over the place.\n\nAnd so, we're very upbeat about this next year."

          "topic": "Cloud at Customer and Supply Constraints",
          "content": "Well, I will admit that the past couple of years have been really challenging, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. I think, our excellent relationships with our wonderful suppliers made it possible for us to build out our cloud, as well as provide hardware to our customers. We couldn't meet every need as quickly as we would have liked, and we have an extremely large backlog. That is absolutely true.\n\nThat backlog also gives me enormous visibility because those customers have told us they want cloud at customer or they want hardware. And I have a line of sight to get it landed in their facilities. The reality is that we have so much going on at the same time. We've built out our cloud internationally.\n\nWe've built a number of private clouds where it is exactly the same capability as our public cloud for our customers who have regulatory requirements that require something special or whether it's data sovereignty or otherwise. And we are meeting everyone's needs. And I think, that, again, the incredible optimism you hear from me and Larry is very much because we have line of sight to the massive demand that has been coming our way and that we've been handling and a line of sight on how to deliver it. So now, I read the newspaper -- actually, I don't read the newspaper.\n\nI read the computer that used to be a newspaper. And so, we see everything that's going on. But I'm extremely confident in the capabilities of my team to execute."

          "topic": "Ecosystem Wins with OCI",
          "content": "Well, I think, it's broad-based. I think, one of -- the back office -- one of our partners -- we're working with one of the largest banks on the planet with -- on a payment system, a B2B payment system because the ERP customers are coming to Oracle. So if you look at the future with the fact that we're so strong, dominant, I'd argue, in cloud ERP, what does the B2B purchase look like? A B2B purchase looks like, in a modern cloud world, one Oracle ERP system making a purchase from another Oracle ERP system. And we want to automate that B2B transaction, that the two Oracle ERP systems are talking to one another.\n\nAnd to automate that transaction, we have to be able to pay for that -- we have to be able to check credit, finance the payments, arrange logistics. So we're working with a large -- a very large bank and a very large logistics company to automate that aspect of our ERP business. Some of it's never been -- you don't think of ERP doing that, but it's this network of these ERP systems talking to one another. That's a huge business revenue opportunity to turn on that B2B payment system.\n\nSo the banks are joining in. Logistic companies are joining in because the customers are here. Once the ERP customers started coming to Oracle, all of the adjacent applications and all the ISVs with adjacent applications wanted to be in the same cloud as the ERP customers. The integrators had to become familiar with the cloud because that's where the customers are, and that's where customers are going.\n\nThe ISVs. And these are kind of interesting ISVs. Giant banks, giant logistics companies putting up their logistics and payment systems in our cloud to facilitate B2B transactions between our ERP system is just a gigantic business opportunity that no one really ever thought about before."

          "content": "Well, I think, we can do it. We're on our way to do it. And the benefits to Oracle are great. But actually, it's -- this is -- at least for me, personally, this is a mission.\n\nI think, the benefits to every patient in the world is going to be enormous. We need to do this. The pandemic has shown a variety of weaknesses in our healthcare systems. We have the technology to address those weaknesses, and that's what we're going to do."

So, Safra, you mentioned on the conference call that you guys are putting up this type of result. Even on the backdrop, that's not the most stable kind of macro backdrop.\n\nAnd we're seeing a lot of other software companies being slipped deals, seeing issues with the consumer, Internet companies lowering their spend. Do you guys seem to be working through this very well? Can you give us some color into how you're doing it? Is it better execution? Is the Oracle value proposition going through more clearly? Can you help us understand where you're able to put up a bigger beat when a lot of guys are working with skinnier beta at all during this period?"

Larry, we picked up a meaningful uptick in the number of large enterprise agreements or ULAs that customers are doing with Oracle. And in particular, to satisfy their database needs, both on-premise and also in the cloud.\n\nDo you have any telemetry or other insights into customer behavior to see where they're deploying these licenses? And can you talk about why BYOL is so important to your strategy and the longevity of Oracle database? And maybe just for Safra as well, that license number was so strong. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned license growth was led by database use in the cloud by major app cloud SaaS companies. Just wondering if there's any more color you can provide there."

With the increasing concerns of recession by many, can you tell me what you're seeing for the apps part of the business and more specifically for ERP? What I'm trying to understand is how will the shift in ERP to the cloud be impacted by any economic slowdown or won't it be? How should we think about that?"

          "question_text": "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, Safra, you expected organic revenue growth to reach double digits next fiscal year. And so congratulations on reaching that double-digit milestone this quarter.\n\nNow within today's results, two numbers really stood out to us. First was the upside to license revenue. And then second was your commentary about total database revenue growing in the double digits. So my question is, Safra, Larry, can you give us more color on what's driving that reacceleration in license revenue in particular? Even as cloud revenue inflected to its highest growth rate in more than four years, is this BYOL bringing the heat? Is this autonomous database getting big enough and growing fast enough to lift the overall number, etc.\n\nAnd is this the broad-based demand that you mentioned on the Q3 call? Or is this more big deal driven?"

And then just to clarify on the buyback, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. Is the pace of buyback that we saw this last quarter still reasonable for the near term, even with the incremental debt from Cerner?"
