          "content": "Katy, hi, it's Tim. We're obviously monitoring our daily sales very closely. From an inflation point of view, we are seeing inflation. It is evident in our gross margin last quarter and in our OpEx last quarter and it is assumed in the guidance that Luca gave for this quarter as well. So we're definitely seeing some level of inflation that I think everybody is seeing."

          "topic": "Supply Constraints and Product Impact",
          "content": "Yes. Good question. For Q2 so the quarter that we just finished, the restrictions in China had not started yet. And so Q2, we did have supply constraints. They were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter. They were driven by industry-wide silicon shortages. And specifically, the issue that I talked about on previous calls with the legacy nodes. But looking ahead, we see two causes of supply constraints. One is the COVID-related disruptions; and there's the industry-wide silicon shortages that will continue. We've estimated the constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. And if you – these constraints are primarily centered around the Shanghai corridor. And the – on a positive front, almost all of the affected final assembly factories have now restarted. And so the range – the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects various ramps of getting back up and running. We're also encouraged that the COVID case count that's been reported in Shanghai has decreased over the last few days. And so there's some reason for optimism there."

          "topic": "iPhone Growth and Market Share",
          "content": "We were happy with the iPhone growth last quarter, particularly when you think about the comp that it was against because we had very different timing on the launches in the year ago quarter where we launched in Q1. And therefore naturally Q2 is at a different place on the new product curve. And so, it was a very difficult comp. And so we were pleased with it. And as Luca said, the Americas geography did quite well last quarter. And the US, of course, is the major geography within there. And so the US was quite strong last quarter."

          "topic": "Supply Chain Strategy and Inventory Management",
          "content": "Well, we're always looking and we continue to look. But we would only acquire something that were strategic. We acquire a lot of smaller companies today and we'll continue to do that for IP and for great talent. And -- but we don't discount doing something larger either if the opportunity presents itself. And so -- but I don't want to go through my list with you on the phone, but we're always looking."

          "topic": "Freight and Production Footprint Strategy",
          "content": "Freight is a huge challenge in today both from an inflationary point of view and from an availability point of view. And so right now the focus is on moving the freight to customers any way that we can do that. Over time, we'll do that much more efficiently. We have lots of customers that we want to get the new Macs to. And so we're working hard on them. They are a result of the combination of the COVID disruptions and the silicon shortage that we've talked about before."

          "topic": "Geographic Growth Vectors",
          "content": "Amit, as you said in the Americas, we had a very strong quarter up 19% very happy across the board there. Europe, again was a really good quarter for us. We grew 5% in spite of the fact that during the month of March, we paused our sales in Russia. So we had an impact to our sales results there for a month of the quarter. But a number of European countries particularly in Western Europe did really, really well for us. And so it was a very good quarter for us pretty much in line with our expectations. Americas was better than our expectations. China was again a March quarter record for us. Keep in mind and this affected every geographic segment for us the different launch timing for the iPhone this year versus a year ago had an impact on the March quarter results because we launched the product later a year ago than we did this year. So some of the channel fill for the new products happened during the March quarter a year ago. Japan and Asia Pacific were affected by foreign exchange. Japan would have grown in line with company average in constant currency terms. Asia Pacific as well was affected by foreign exchange with the dollar appreciating against most currencies. And then again this difference in the launch timing for the iPhone made a difference. Keep in mind again the supply constraints that we had during the quarter our results would have been obviously better without the supply constraints. Overall we felt very good about the performance around the world."

          "topic": "Services Performance and Growth",
          "content": "Yes, Shannon. It was really great on all fronts. We said December quarter records in every geographic segment. And then as I mentioned earlier, an all-time record for cloud, for music, for video, for advertising, for payment services. December quarter record in the App Store. So we've done better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. This overperformance has been spread around the world and spread around our services categories. The reality is this combination of factors, the fact that the installed base is growing, the fact that we continue to have more and more engagement of our customers on all the services -- paid subscriptions is a phenomenal story. We now have 785 million paid subs. We've increased 165 million in the last 12 months alone. So all these things combined are really powering the business. Very, very pleased with the performance."
