Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration and design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. There are applications for control centers and command centers. SAP has really gotten behind it, and of course, SAP is integrated into many companies. There will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple, and it took a whole company effort to bring it this far."

          "content": "We were up 6% in the December quarter, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, and we are happy with that performance. We had a really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific. We did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East and set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. We set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders, and the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with our overall devices. iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia. The customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. Since the announcement and shipment in September, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14 over the same period of time. We feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us."

          "content": "We've concluded that we can do both consumer and enterprise effectively. Over the last several years, employees in many companies have the ability to choose their own technology, which decentralizes decision-making. This is a huge advantage for Apple because many people want to use a Mac at home and in the office. The iPad has also benefited from this trend. With Vision Pro, we are starting with a million apps and over 600 designed specifically for it. The innovations coming out of Enterprise are some of the most innovative I've seen in a long time. There's a similar opportunity for Vision Pro as there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, the iPhone has been integral to enterprise since its early days. We see a nice opportunity for Vision Pro in this space as well."

          "topic": "June Quarter Guidance and Services Growth",
          "content": "Hey, Mike. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first half of our fiscal year. And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad-based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. We've also seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. So very pleased with the way the services business is going."

          "topic": "Generative AI and Capital Expenditure",
          "content": "Yes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Generative AI. We are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than $100 billion in research and development. On the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side. We purchase some of the tools and manufacturing equipment, and in some cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the data center side, we have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward."

          "topic": "Services Growth and Gross Margin",
          "content": "A number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. So we see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services. Those all set all-time revenue records. We feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half."

        {
          "topic": "Product Gross Margins and Commodity Costs",
          "content": "Yes. During the last quarter, commodity costs and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, it's been a period not only this quarter but the last several quarters where commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities go through cycles and there's always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. So we're starting from a good point. We try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. We will try to mitigate if there are headwinds, but in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape."

We are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. We will continue to invest in every area of the business at the appropriate level. We've put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years. As you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback from $90 billion to $110 billion. Once we reach net cash-neutral, we'll reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time."

Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. The same applies for foreign exchange, which will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points."

And then on the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.",

        "Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores, which clearly disposes some security risks on one hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.",
        "Luca, can you comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted both mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines? Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures."

        "Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? And how could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow up, please.",
        "Luca, can you just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help and mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all?"

        "You have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? How do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?",
        "Regarding the China market, you mentioned that iPhone in Mainland China grew before adjusting for the $5 billion impact from last year's supply disruption. The overall Greater China was down 8%, driven by iPhone. Do you think the decline is more macro-driven or competitive-driven over there?"

How are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said outside of China and what changes in consumer demand or receptivity to new devices? Is AI initiative driving demand, or is it more of a timing issue with the replacement cycle being a bit long?",
