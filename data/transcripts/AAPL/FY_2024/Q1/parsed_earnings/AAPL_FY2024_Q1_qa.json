          "content": "Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew in revenue terms with strong double-digits in the December quarter and hit a quarterly revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record. We had several regions with records from Latin America to the Middle East. This theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well. Emerging markets are very, very important, and I feel like we are doing a great job there."

          "content": "We are incredibly excited about the Enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration and design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. There are applications for control centers and command centers. SAP has really gotten behind it, and of course, SAP is integrated into many companies. There will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple, and it took a whole company effort to bring it this far."

          "content": "We were up 6% in the December quarter, as we mentioned in the opening remarks, and we are happy with that performance. We had a really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific. We did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East and set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. We set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders, and the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with our overall devices. iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia. The customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. Since the announcement and shipment in September, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14 over the same period of time. We feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us."

          "topic": "Enterprise and AI Integration",
          "content": "We've concluded that we can do both consumer and enterprise effectively. Over the last several years, employees in many companies have the ability to choose their own technology, which decentralizes decision-making. This is a huge advantage for Apple because many people want to use a Mac at home and in the office. The iPad has also benefited from this trend. With Vision Pro, we are starting with a million apps and over 600 designed specifically for it. The innovations coming out of Enterprise are some of the most innovative I've seen in a long time. There's a similar opportunity for Vision Pro as there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, the iPhone has been integral to enterprise since its early days. We see a nice opportunity for Vision Pro in this space as well."

          "topic": "Services Growth and Drivers",
          "content": "Thanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. We were up 11%, reaching $23.1 billion, which is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. It was broad-based geographically and very strong across all Services categories, including cloud, payments, video, advertising, the App Store, and AppleCare. Last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% growth is even stronger than it appears. The entire ecosystem is doing well with growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is very important. Paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double-digits, now exceeding a billion across all services on our platform, more than double the number from four years ago. For the March quarter, we expect to continue growing double-digits at a similar percentage to the December quarter. We don't provide guidance on specific services categories but will offer more details in three months."

          "topic": "Product Revenue and Gross Margin",
          "content": "On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially by 280 basis points, which is a significant improvement. The two primary factors are a favorable mix, particularly strong performance in high-end iPhone models, and leverage from it being our biggest quarter of the year. We had a partial offset from foreign exchange impacts, but overall, the improvement is very significant. On the Services side, we increased gross margins sequentially by 190 basis points, also due to a more favorable mix. Combined, this gives us a total company gross margin of 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially. We are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion compared to the already strong December quarter results."

        {
          "topic": "Supply Impact on iPhone",
          "content": "Regarding the $5 billion impact in the March quarter, this is entirely related to iPhone. Last year, we experienced a disruption in supply for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max due to factory shutdowns from COVID-19. This led to pent-up demand, which was fulfilled as we exited the December quarter, along with channel fill during the March quarter. On the gross margin side, we maintain very high levels, guiding to 46% to 47%, which accounts for the commodity environment, foreign exchange, and product and services mix. This guidance reflects strong overall performance, and we are very happy with it."

        "Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question regarding the quickly emerging application of large model inference. It's understood that you have a significant share of the training market. Smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. With many large models like GPT, there's a new workload accelerating rapidly on large model inference. Your Grace Hopper Superchip products seem well aligned for that. Could you talk about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that?"

        "First, regarding Services outlook for the March quarter with a similar double-digit growth rate as the December quarter. Why might it not be potentially faster, given that the December quarter had a headwind from the extra week comp, and some pricing uplifts on select Apple One services implemented last winter should help? Any additional thoughts on your assumptions?",
        "Second, could you talk about efforts to support the Vision Pro developer ecosystem and any potential upcoming announcements on AI?"
