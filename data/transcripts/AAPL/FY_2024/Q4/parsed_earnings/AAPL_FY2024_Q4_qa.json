          "topic": "Apple Intelligence Features and Adoption",
          "content": "Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. In the first three days, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. There's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, including even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. It's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. As we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out starting in April and more features as well. It's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it."

          "topic": "iPhone Replacement Cycles and Pent-Up Demand",
          "content": "Yes, hi Erik. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. The 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. That's the current state. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. We believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade."

        {
          "topic": "China Market Performance and Strategy",
          "content": "Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. On a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. Over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related, which is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year. We're happy to see the acceleration. iPhone in particular for Greater China saw the installed base set a record. Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders, which is a very strong signal. According to Kantar, this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Additionally, the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch in September 2023 shows that the 15 is outperforming the 14. We're also very focused on the level of new customers buying our products. On the Mac and iPad in Mainland China, the majority of customers are buying for the first time, and the Watch has over three-quarters of customers being new to the product. During the quarter, the iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. We continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China."

We couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. This will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. We're taking the first step in getting the beta out there and can't wait to see the amazing things they do with it."

We've released a lot of APIs and developers are taking advantage of those APIs. This will enhance the ecosystem and user experience, positively impacting Services. Developers will integrate Apple Intelligence deeply into their apps, which we believe will drive greater engagement and monetization within our Services portfolio."

          "topic": "Wearables, Home, and Accessories Category",
          "content": "The Wearables, Home, and Accessories categories have a difficult launch compare from last year's continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. However, over the trailing 12 months, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago."

          "content": "Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, we've mentioned before that we have a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers, and in some cases, we use third-party providers. Our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others, but we are rolling out Apple Intelligence features and making all the necessary capacity available. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx incurred during fiscal '24, and in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the necessary investments, including those related to AI."

          "topic": "Services Growth Recurring vs Transactional",
          "content": "Yes, Amit, we are very happy to have reached a $100 billion run rate in Services. Our portfolio is highly diversified. Over the years, the recurring portion of our Services business has grown and is now growing faster than the transactional portion. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across our platform, including our own services and third-party services. Paid subscriptions are growing strong double-digits, and this has been consistent for many quarters. We continue to launch new services and improve the quality and content of existing ones, which drives both ARPU and volume growth."

          "topic": "Capital Expenditure and Apple Intelligence",
          "content": "Yes, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years, with significant expenditures in research and development. Our CapEx approach remains a hybrid model, making investments ourselves and sharing them with suppliers and partners. This includes manufacturing equipment and data center capacity. We will continue this approach as we roll out Apple Intelligence and other new technologies."

          "topic": "Product Gross Margins and Commodity Costs",
          "content": "Yes, for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are moving down in price, while NAND and DRAM have increased during the September quarter and are expected to increase during the December quarter. Our gross margins are at record levels for the fiscal year, and we are guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter. This takes into account the current commodity environment and foreign exchange headwinds."

          "topic": "Free Cash Flow Margins and Services Mix",
          "content": "We are pleased with our free cash flow margins for the first nine months, driven by improved top-line performance and continued margin expansion. Our capital allocation strategy focuses on returning capital to shareholders through buybacks while making necessary investments in the business. We maintain a disciplined approach to capital efficiency, ensuring that we invest in growth opportunities while optimizing our capital structure."

I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. And I have a follow-up, thank you.",
        "My second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much."

      "questions": [
        "Tim, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. I'm curious whether you've been able to get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. What have you learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down, and being more price sensitive? Any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.",
        "Luca, regarding commodity prices and gross margins: with component price inflation and mix changes, can you help us understand your view of component prices and whether they remain tailwinds to gross margins or might become headwinds as we look forward?"

        "With regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, when you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? What are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up.",
        "Hey, Tim, now that you've launched or announced Apple Intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services? Would it accelerate your Services business augmented? Maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks."

        "First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?",
        "With the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period?"

        "Maybe back to iPhones, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is recurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?",
        "If I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you."

      "questions": [
        "Tim, I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it.",
        "Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward?"

What might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?",
        "Luca, regarding your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position, and staying around $50 billion of net cash over the last two years, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?"

Are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or should we be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?",
