          "topic": "iPhone Replacement Cycles and Pent-Up Demand",
          "content": "Yes, hi Erik. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade."

          "topic": "China Market Performance and Strategy",
          "content": "Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term."

          "topic": "June Quarter Guidance and Services Growth",
          "content": "Hey, Mike. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first half of our fiscal year. And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad-based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. We've also seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. So very pleased with the way the services business is going."

        {
          "topic": "Generative AI and Capital Expenditure",
          "content": "Yes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Generative AI. We are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than $100 billion in research and development. On the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side. We purchase some of the tools and manufacturing equipment, and in some cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the data center side, we have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward."

          "topic": "Services Growth and Gross Margin",
          "content": "A number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. So we see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services. Those all set all-time revenue records. We feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half."

        {
          "topic": "Product Gross Margins and Commodity Costs",
          "content": "Yes. During the last quarter, commodity costs and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, it's been a period not only this quarter but the last several quarters where commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities go through cycles and there's always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. So we're starting from a good point. We try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. We will try to mitigate if there are headwinds, but in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape."

          "topic": "Capital Allocation and Gross Margin Guidance",
          "content": "We've always said we will never underinvest in the business. We are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. We will continue to invest in every area of the business at the appropriate level. We've put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years. As you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback from $90 billion to $110 billion. Once we reach net cash-neutral, we'll reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time."

          "topic": "June Quarter Gross Margin Guidance",

Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. The same applies for foreign exchange, which will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points."

        "Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you."

Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period?"

        "Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time?",
        "And then Luca, when we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?"

      "questions": [
        "Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it.",
        "Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward?"

      "questions": [
        "Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers?",
        "And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?"
