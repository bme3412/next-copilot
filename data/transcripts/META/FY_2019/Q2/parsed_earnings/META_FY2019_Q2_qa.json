          "topic": "Libra and Regulatory Environment",
          "content": "On Libra, we knew it would be heavily scrutinized and that there's a long ramp-up, including consultation with regulators, experts, and stakeholders. We published the white paper early and are taking an open, collaborative approach. Our goal is to create a safe, stable, and well-regulated product, and we’ll continue to engage with regulators to address their concerns."

        {
          "topic": "Long-Term Privacy-Focused Vision",
          "content": "Shifting toward a more privacy-focused platform is a multiyear effort. Over the next year or two, we’ll focus on the technical architecture—end-to-end encryption, interoperability, and security. Then we’ll build business ecosystems on top of these private messaging platforms. It will take several years before these efforts significantly impact our business, but we’ll show progress along the way."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Payments and Commerce Initiatives",
          "content": "We’re excited about commerce and payments, including fiat currency support. Efforts span across Instagram Shopping, Facebook Marketplace, and WhatsApp Business, as well as experiments with new payment systems. The idea is to reduce friction, make commerce more seamless, and ultimately increase ad value. Libra is one element, but we’re also focusing on simpler payment solutions to drive value for people and businesses in the near term."

        {
          "topic": "Facebook Communities and Engagement",
          "content": "Helping people connect with communities in addition to friends and family is a top priority. Our recent redesign and emphasis on groups have contributed to strong engagement trends on the Facebook app. This focus on meaningful communities will play a key role in sustaining and improving user engagement over time."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Marketplace and Economic Opportunity",
          "content": "Marketplace and related features like Jobs enable economic activity across our platforms. While we don’t plan to charge for basic listings, we see opportunities to drive value through ads. Over time, as users and businesses transact more seamlessly, the ad ecosystem should benefit. Payments and commerce features will help close the loop, making our ad products more effective."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Regulatory Landscape",
          "content": "We’ve made progress on issues like election integrity, harmful content, and privacy, but these remain major social challenges. We believe that well-thought-out regulation will help address the trade-offs in areas like content moderation and data portability. We're working with global regulators, including those in the U.S. and Europe, advocating for clear frameworks. Although the process is complex, we’re committed to being part of the solution."

          "topic": "Video Advertising and Creatives",
          "content": "Video is important across our apps and formats. Users now watch and share video easily, and we see opportunities for marketers. However, mobile-first video creative differs from TV-style ads. We encourage advertisers to tailor their messaging for quick, attention-grabbing formats. Mobile-first video now accounts for over 50% of video ad revenue. Brands like McDonald’s have seen strong results when adapting creative for mobile, with double-digit lifts in recall and incremental reach."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Stories Ads and Automated Placements",
          "content": "Stories ads are available across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Lessons learned from the shift to mobile help us move advertisers to this new format quickly. Automatic placements convert feed ads into stories format, making it easy for advertisers. With three million advertisers using our stories ads across platforms, early adopters benefit from attractive pricing. While monetization is currently lower than feed, we see stories as a big long-term opportunity."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Checkout on Instagram",
          "content": "Checkout on Instagram is in a very small, closed beta with 23 brands. It’s too early for broad insights, but initial feedback suggests it reduces friction in the shopping experience. Our focus is on getting this right for consumers first. Commerce initiatives like checkout help close the loop for advertisers and improve measurement, ultimately enhancing ad value. This is long-term and not immediately about direct monetization."

          "topic": "Ad Targeting Headwinds",
          "content": "We foresee ad targeting headwinds from three main areas: regulatory changes (e.g., GDPR and global equivalents), platform changes focusing on privacy (affecting measurement and targeting), and our own product changes to emphasize privacy. These factors will compound, particularly later in 2019 and into 2020, contributing to revenue growth deceleration."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Revenue Growth Deceleration Factors",
          "content": "Our strong impression growth in Q2 was driven by Instagram Stories, Instagram Feed, and Facebook Feed. However, more impressions are coming from areas with lower monetization rates, like Stories and lower-ARPU regions, which impacts overall pricing. As we lap strong product optimizations and face these headwinds, we expect constant currency revenue growth deceleration to resume, especially in Q4 due to tougher comparisons."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Expense Growth and Guidance",
          "content": "We continue to invest heavily in areas like privacy compliance, infrastructure, security, content moderation, and innovation. 2019 expenses include these investments and the FTC settlement accrual. While we previously discussed that 2020 expense growth may be more in line with revenue growth, we’re not providing new specific guidance. Investments in privacy and safety remain priorities. The Q2 cost increase partly reflects depreciation from past CapEx and legal expenses."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Europe and Regulatory Impacts",
          "content": "Europe’s growth is slower than North America and APAC, in part due to currency and past impacts from GDPR. As we lap the initial GDPR period, growth in Europe has reaccelerated somewhat. Still, Europe’s growth lags behind other regions, and we remain attentive to evolving regulations and their long-term implications."
