          "topic": "Payments Strategy and Integration",
          "content": "We’re pursuing multiple payment initiatives: building on existing infrastructure with WhatsApp Payments and Facebook Pay, and exploring new infrastructure through Libra. Our aim is to streamline payments across our apps, making it easier for people and small businesses to buy, sell, and transact. For small businesses, seamless payments can boost the value of our ad platforms, driving more bidding and higher ad prices over time."

        {
          "topic": "Branding and Integration Across Apps",
          "content": "We’ll maintain distinct brands for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, but deepen their technical integration. Much of our infrastructure is already shared, and we’re working toward enabling features, tools, and improvements to benefit all apps simultaneously. While each service keeps its identity, we’ll standardize certain layers—like voice calling or messaging protocols—to innovate faster and deliver better experiences across the family of apps."

          "topic": "Election Integrity and Content Regulation",
          "content": "We’re far more prepared for the 2020 U.S. elections than we were in 2016. We’ve developed stronger systems, partnerships with industry and governments, and refined detection of interference tactics. We’ve successfully managed other major elections (e.g., EU Parliament), and while adversaries evolve, we’re confident we can protect election integrity more effectively. Some foreign actors may attempt not only direct interference but also to sow doubt about legitimacy; we’re vigilant about these challenges."

          "topic": "Facebook Dating and Product Expansion",
          "content": "Facebook Dating is now available in multiple countries and the U.S., and we’re pleased with its traction. Like Marketplace, Watch, and News, Dating targets a subset of users who find it valuable. Over time, we envision people using News Feed and then adopting two or three additional functionalities like Dating or Marketplace, leading to strong overall engagement. We’ll continue iterating and expanding as we learn from user feedback."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Video Strategy with Watch",
          "content": "Our video strategy involves separating passive video viewing from core feed experiences. Watch is a dedicated space for longer-form content, helping keep core News Feed focused on meaningful interactions. We occasionally fund premium content as “tent poles” to bring people into Watch, but we’re not building a subscription model. Our approach balances video consumption with the platform’s core goal of fostering connections and community."

          "topic": "Instagram Checkout and Commerce",
          "content": "Checkout on Instagram remains in early testing. We’re moving slowly, ensuring full integration and a seamless end-to-end experience. This involves deep partnerships so users can discover products, check inventory, and complete purchases smoothly. Although we’re cautiously expanding shopping and checkout ads, our broader commerce strategy remains focused on discovery-driven commerce ads on Facebook and Instagram."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Messaging Monetization (Click-to-Messaging Ads)",
          "content": "While we’re cautious about direct ads in messaging, click-to-messaging ads are growing rapidly. These ads run in Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Stories, linking users directly to Messenger or WhatsApp. SMBs find them valuable for moving customers down the funnel, delivering stronger ROI. For example, Manulife in Vietnam used click-to-messaging ads for lead generation with excellent results, showcasing messaging’s potential for businesses."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Marketplace Growth and Ads",
          "content": "Marketplace now serves hundreds of millions of users monthly. Ads in Marketplace (available in 94 markets) extend News Feed ads into a high-intent environment where users are already shopping. Retail and auto advertisers are particularly interested. While it’s early days, Marketplace is a promising opportunity to deepen our commerce ecosystem."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Instagram Explore Ads",
          "content": "With over 50% of Instagram accounts using Explore monthly, we’ve rolled out ads in Explore to all advertisers. After tapping a post in Explore’s grid, users enter a feed-like experience where we can show ads. As Explore is geared for discovery, it offers a unique environment for advertisers to reach users in a discovery mindset."

        {
          "topic": "Ad Targeting and Privacy Headwinds",
          "content": "We rely on signals from user activity on third-party sites to deliver relevant ads. Regulatory initiatives (GDPR, CCPA), mobile OS/browser privacy changes, and our own privacy tools (e.g., off-Facebook activity controls) will limit these signals, impacting targeting and measurement. Most of these headwinds still lie ahead, affecting small businesses disproportionately by reducing their ability to reach the right audiences efficiently."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Q4 Growth and Regional Trends",
          "content": "We saw no big surprises in Q4. North America and other mature markets are growing more slowly, as expected. The holiday season was strong despite fewer shopping days. Overall performance matched our outlook, with continued strength in less mature markets. We continue to face gradual deceleration in developed regions as the ad market saturates."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Expense Growth Drivers in 2020",
          "content": "Expense growth will come from headcount increases, especially in R&D, privacy, safety, and innovation areas. Infrastructure costs rise as we depreciate past CapEx investments. We also plan to increase marketing and content spending. While headcount grew ~26% recently, we expect hiring across 2020 to support these strategic priorities."
        },
        {
          "topic": "ARPU Differences Across Regions",
          "content": "U.S. ARPU far exceeds other regions due to economic maturity and higher advertiser demand. Europe includes both developed and emerging markets, bringing down average ARPU. Faster growth in lower-ARPU regions (APAC, Rest of World) also affects global averages. As these markets mature economically, ARPU may rise, but structural differences persist."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Facebook Engagement and Core Feed",
          "content": "Core Facebook engagement remains strong. In the U.S. and Canada, non-video feed engagement drives growth, while internationally, video and Stories usage contributes. Adoption of Stories and messaging products (WhatsApp Status, etc.) also boosts engagement globally. We’re encouraged by sustained, broad-based engagement growth on our platforms."
