          "topic": "Generative AI Impact on Advertising",
          "content": "Generative AI presents a significant opportunity to enhance user engagement and provide more value to advertisers. We're integrating large language models and diffusion models to generate images, videos, avatars, and 3D assets across our products. These technologies will empower creators to be more productive and creative, which in turn drives more engagement and opens up new advertising opportunities. Additionally, we're exploring AI agents in messaging platforms to enable small businesses to interact with customers more effectively. While details are still emerging, we plan to launch various generative AI features in the coming months."

          "content": "Generative AI will touch every single one of our products and services in multiple ways. This broad integration aims to create more engaging experiences for users and provide advertisers with innovative tools to enhance their campaigns. The technology is expected to drive both engagement and monetization by offering more personalized and dynamic content."

          "topic": "Open Sourcing AI Models and Infrastructure",
          "content": "We differentiate between our products and the technical infrastructure. While our core products remain proprietary, we have a history of open-sourcing our infrastructure tools, such as PyTorch and contributions to the Open Compute Project. This approach fosters industry standardization, drives down costs, and allows us to integrate innovations from the broader community. For generative AI, we plan to open-source foundational models and tools to support an open ecosystem, which will enable developers to build upon our platforms and enhance engagement and revenue opportunities."

          "topic": "Efficiency and Operational Discipline",
          "content": "We've entered a phase where efficiency is paramount. Rapid growth has slowed, necessitating a focus on operational efficiency to execute more effectively and attract top talent. This involves reducing management layers, improving workflows, and enhancing our ability to build and ship products quickly. Our investments in AI and other technologies are aligned with this efficiency goal, ensuring that we can maintain profitability while continuing to innovate."

          "topic": "Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Data Center Architecture",
          "content": "We're shifting our data centers to a new architecture that supports both AI and non-AI workloads more efficiently. This new design is cheaper and faster to build, providing greater flexibility to scale based on demand. Our phased approach allows us to build base plans with less initial capacity and scale up quickly as needed. This shift is expected to reduce long-term capital intensity and improve overall cash flow by lowering CapEx as a percentage of revenue."

          "topic": "Operating Expense (OpEx) and Hiring Expectations",
          "content": "Regarding hiring expectations for 2024, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze over the past six months. As we complete our layoffs in April and May, we will resume hiring and expect headcount growth in excess of 1% to 2% in 2024 as we ramp up recruiting pipelines. Our long-term focus remains on efficiency, with hiring concentrated in priority areas such as generative AI, ads, infrastructure, and Reality Labs. Additionally, our investments in AI tools internally are expected to enhance employee productivity, although we do not yet have full visibility on the extent of this impact."

        {
          "topic": "Restructuring Charges and Expense Outlook",
          "content": "For 2023, our expense outlook has been adjusted downward by $3 billion to $5 billion, primarily due to slower payroll growth, reduced growth in cost of revenue through extended server lifespans, and lower office facilities consolidation charges. We anticipate recognizing further restructuring charges throughout the year. These adjustments reflect our ongoing efforts to build financial discipline and operational efficiency."

        {
          "topic": "Regulatory Challenges in Europe",
          "content": "Regarding the transatlantic data transfer rules, we are hopeful that the new EU-U.S. privacy framework will be implemented before any suspension occurs. If a suspension is mandated, it is unclear how long it would last or the specifics of the final order. Approximately 10% of our worldwide ad revenue comes from the EU, and while we believe our current practices are GDPR compliant, we are actively appealing the rulings and working closely with regulators to mitigate any negative impacts on our advertising capabilities in Europe."

        {
          "topic": "Shop Ads Growth",
          "content": "In Q1, we continued to test shop ads in the U.S., observing increased performance by directing consumers to points of purchase. The shop ads beta currently has a revenue run rate in the hundreds of millions of dollars, showing triple-digit growth in both revenue and adoption. We expect this growth to normalize to lower levels in 2023, with shop ads contributing significantly to our revenue streams as they scale."

          "content": "We are very pleased with the engagement trends we're observing. Aggregate time spent on Instagram and Facebook is up year-over-year both in the U.S. and globally. Reels continues to add incremental time spent without significantly cannibalizing other surfaces like Feed and Stories. This positive trend indicates the durability and relevance of our platforms in our oldest market."

          "topic": "Reels Monetization and Revenue Impact",
          "content": "Reels currently operates at a $3 billion revenue run rate but is still a $500 million revenue headwind this quarter. We expect to turn Reels into a revenue tailwind within the next 12 to 18 months as we enhance monetization efficiency. Our strategy focuses on scaling Reels engagement and optimizing ad placements to drive profitable growth."

          "topic": "ATT Impact and Mitigation",
          "content": "The impact of Apple's ATT changes is primarily due to lapping the rollout period. While we see some benefits from lapping the rollout, macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges. Our efforts to mitigate ATT impacts include enhancing our ad tools, investing in AI-driven targeting, and promoting on-site conversions through products like click-to-messaging ads. These initiatives are helping us offset some of the revenue declines caused by ATT."

This new architecture supports both AI and non-AI workloads more effectively and is cheaper and faster to build. By adopting a phased approach, we can scale capacity based on demand without significant upfront capital outlays, improving our cash flow and reducing CapEx as a percentage of revenue over time."

          "content": "Reels is contributing positively to overall engagement on our platforms. We are actively working on closing the monetization gap between Reels and other surfaces like Feed and Stories. With ongoing improvements in ad targeting and content recommendations driven by AI, we anticipate that Reels will soon become a revenue driver rather than a headwind."

          "topic": "Metaverse Investment and Capital Allocation",
          "content": "Investments in the metaverse through Reality Labs remain a long-term commitment. We are increasing our investment in this area while maintaining discipline across the entire operating posture of the company. These investments are essential for positioning Meta as a leader in the next generation of social interaction and digital economy."

Our focus includes growing on-site conversions with products like lead ads and click-to-messaging ads. Investments in AI and machine learning are enhancing our measurement, targeting, and delivery capabilities. Early examples, such as Advantage+ Shopping, have shown promising results with a 32% increase in return on ad spend for advertisers. We are also collaborating with the industry to develop privacy-enhancing technologies to support advertisers in this new environment."

These ads are bringing incremental demand to our platform, with over 40% of our advertisers using Reels across our apps. Advertisers are seeing significant ROI improvements, such as lower cost per acquisition and higher conversion rates. Examples include businesses achieving higher qualified leads and lower costs per lead compared to traditional ad formats."
