This shift is part of our strategy to drive more engagement through Reels while maintaining strong engagement levels on our platforms. We believe these changes are incremental and beneficial to total user time spent."

On measurement, we've made substantial progress in addressing the underreporting gap and expect continued improvements throughout the year. For targeting, we're rebuilding our optimization systems to work with less data by leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies and industry collaborations. These efforts are part of a multi-year strategy to maintain effective personalized advertising while respecting user privacy. However, small businesses are facing greater challenges due to these changes, as they rely heavily on precise targeting to reach their audiences."

These investments enable us to enhance our recommendation systems, ad targeting, and overall user engagement. We have seen a 15% watch time gain for Facebook Reels from a single AI advancement, and we anticipate additional improvements.

Over half of the OpEx growth in 2023 is driven by headcount-related costs from employees hired in 2022, primarily in technical and senior roles. We expect headcount to be roughly flat by the end of 2023. On the cost of revenue side, growth will accelerate due to increased depreciation from prior CapEx investments and Reality Labs' next-generation Quest headset launch."
