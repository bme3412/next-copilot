          "content": "Reels is experiencing significant growth, contributing to a 30% increase in time spent across Facebook and Instagram. While Reels does take some time away from other surfaces like Feed and Stories, the net impact on overall engagement is positive. This shift is part of our strategy to drive more engagement through Reels while maintaining strong engagement levels on our platforms. We believe these changes are incremental and beneficial to total user time spent."

          "content": "The iOS 14 changes present two main challenges: targeting and measurement. On measurement, we've made substantial progress in addressing the underreporting gap and expect continued improvements throughout the year. For targeting, we're rebuilding our optimization systems to work with less data by leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies and industry collaborations. These efforts are part of a multi-year strategy to maintain effective personalized advertising while respecting user privacy. However, small businesses are facing greater challenges due to these changes, as they rely heavily on precise targeting to reach their audiences."

This system continues to serve both advertisers and consumers well, maintaining high ad performance."

The regulatory environment is becoming increasingly challenging, particularly with new regulations in Europe such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These regulations pose significant challenges for our industry, and we are committed to working closely with regulators and implementing privacy-enhancing technologies to navigate these changes."

CapEx is increasing significantly, driven by investments in Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) and the development of our metaverse platforms. We anticipate continued headcount growth and higher operational costs as more employees return to the office."
