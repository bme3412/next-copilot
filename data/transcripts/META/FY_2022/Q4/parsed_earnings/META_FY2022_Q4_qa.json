          "topic": "Generative AI Use Cases and Timeline",
          "content": "Generative AI is an exciting area with two main themes for this year: efficiency and new product areas. We're integrating large language models and diffusion models to generate images, videos, avatars, and 3D assets across our products. These technologies will empower creators to be more productive and creative. We'll be launching various generative AI features this year and sharing updates on their performance. Scaling these technologies efficiently is a key challenge, but we anticipate significant use cases emerging as we overcome these hurdles."

          "topic": "Reels Monetization and Engagement",
          "content": "Our approach with Reels mirrors our philosophy of prioritizing user engagement before monetization. As Reels scales to hundreds of millions of users, we'll focus on ramping up monetization. Currently, Reels is a $3 billion run rate but is still a $500 million revenue headwind. We expect to turn this into a revenue tailwind within the next 12 to 18 months by improving monetization efficiency. Additionally, our AI-driven discovery engine enhances engagement by providing more relevant content across Reels, Stories, and Feed, contributing to overall platform health."

          "topic": "Efficiency and Long-Term Investment Strategy",
          "content": "We've undergone a phase change where rapid growth has slowed, necessitating a greater focus on efficiency. This involves reducing management layers and improving operational workflows, enabling us to execute more effectively and attract top talent. Our investments in the metaverse through Reality Labs continue, but we balance these with initiatives that drive immediate business growth and profitability. Maintaining a disciplined approach to expenses while investing in future technologies is crucial for our long-term success."

          "topic": "Generative AI and Product Development",
          "content": "Generative AI is integral to our product development strategy, enhancing user experiences and creating new opportunities for content creation. By leveraging AI, we're able to offer more personalized and engaging content, which in turn drives higher user engagement and satisfaction. This technology also opens up new avenues for advertisers to create dynamic and interactive ads, further strengthening our advertising ecosystem."

        {
          "topic": "Content Moderation with AI",
          "content": "AI plays a crucial role in our content moderation efforts. We release a community standards enforcement report every quarter, demonstrating that over 90% of actionable content is identified by AI before user reports. Continuous advancements in AI and machine learning are enabling us to maintain a safe and positive environment for our users while scaling our content moderation capabilities."

          "topic": "New Data Center Architecture and Capital Efficiency",
          "content": "We're shifting our data centers to a new architecture that supports both AI and non-AI workloads more efficiently. This new design is cheaper and faster to build, providing us with greater flexibility to scale based on demand. Our phased approach allows us to build base plans with less initial capacity and scale up quickly as needed. This shift is expected to reduce long-term capital intensity and improve overall cash flow by lowering CapEx as a percentage of revenue."

        {
          "topic": "Operating Expense Guidance for 2023",
          "content": "Our 2023 operating expense (OpEx) guidance includes an estimated $2 billion in one-time charges related to office facilities consolidation as we rationalize our real estate footprint. Over half of the OpEx growth in 2023 is driven by headcount-related costs from employees hired in 2022, primarily in technical and senior roles. We expect headcount to be roughly flat by the end of 2023. On the cost of revenue side, growth will accelerate due to increased depreciation from prior CapEx investments and Reality Labs' next-generation Quest headset launch."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and ROI",
          "content": "Our 2023 CapEx is projected to be between $34 billion and $39 billion, driven primarily by investments in AI and machine learning. These investments are enabling enhancements in our recommendation systems, ad targeting, and overall user engagement. We've observed a 15% watch time gain for Facebook Reels from a single AI advancement and anticipate further improvements. The ROI from these AI investments will determine our future CapEx spending. If we continue to see strong engagement and revenue gains, we will maintain or increase our investment levels."

          "topic": "Shop Ads Growth",
          "content": "In Q4, we continued to test shop ads in the U.S. and observed increased performance by directing consumers to points of purchase. The shop ads beta currently has a revenue run rate in the hundreds of millions of dollars, showing triple-digit growth in both revenue and adoption. We expect this growth to normalize to lower levels in 2023, with shop ads contributing significantly to our revenue streams as they scale."

          "topic": "Regulatory Challenges in Europe",
          "content": "Regarding the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) and other regulatory issues, we believe our current approach to data usage and ad targeting is GDPR compliant. We are actively appealing the rulings that challenge our practices and are committed to working closely with regulators to resolve these issues. We do not anticipate these decisions affecting our ability to provide personalized advertising in the EU, allowing advertisers to continue leveraging our platforms effectively."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Expense Outlook Reduction",
          "content": "The primary components of the reduction in our 2023 expense outlook are slower payroll growth due to a broad hiring freeze and reduced headcount growth, slower growth in cost of revenue driven by extending the useful lives of non-AI servers, and lower office facilities consolidation charges. These adjustments allow us to better align our expenses with the current macroeconomic environment and maintain financial discipline."

          "content": "We are very pleased with the engagement trends we're observing. Aggregate time spent on Instagram and Facebook is up year-over-year both in the U.S. and globally. Reels continues to add incremental time spent without significantly cannibalizing other surfaces like Feed and Stories. This positive trend indicates the durability and relevance of our platforms in our oldest market."

We expect to turn Reels into a revenue tailwind within the next 12 to 18 months as we enhance monetization efficiency. Our strategy focuses on scaling Reels engagement and optimizing ad placements to drive profitable growth."

          "topic": "ATT Impact and Mitigation",
          "content": "The impact of Apple's ATT changes is primarily due to lapping the rollout period. While we see some benefits from lapping the rollout, macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges. Our efforts to mitigate ATT impacts include enhancing our ad tools, investing in AI-driven targeting, and promoting on-site conversions through products like click-to-messaging ads. These initiatives are helping us offset some of the revenue declines caused by ATT."

This new architecture supports both AI and non-AI workloads more effectively and is cheaper and faster to build. By adopting a phased approach, we can scale capacity based on demand without significant upfront capital outlays, improving our cash flow and reducing CapEx as a percentage of revenue over time."

          "content": "Reels is contributing positively to overall engagement on our platforms. We are actively working on closing the monetization gap between Reels and other surfaces like Feed and Stories. With ongoing improvements in ad targeting and content recommendations driven by AI, we anticipate that Reels will soon become a revenue driver rather than a headwind."

These investments are essential for positioning Meta as a leader in the next generation of social interaction and digital economy."

Our focus includes growing on-site conversions with products like lead ads and click-to-messaging ads. Investments in AI and machine learning are enhancing our measurement, targeting, and delivery capabilities. Early examples, such as Advantage+ Shopping, have shown promising results with a 32% increase in return on ad spend for advertisers.

These ads are bringing incremental demand to our platform, with over 40% of our advertisers using Reels across our apps. Advertisers are seeing significant ROI improvements, such as lower cost per acquisition and higher conversion rates.
