          "topic": "Commerce, AR/VR, and Creator Economy Initiatives",
          "content": "We focus on these efforts primarily to improve user experiences. For AR/VR, Quest 2’s success and future advancements aim to provide presence and immersive social experiences. With commerce, we move from discovery-based advertising to a more seamless shopping experience—ad to shop to purchase. And supporting the creator economy helps attract top content and engagement. Each initiative is about making products more valuable, which should benefit everyone long term."

          "topic": "Algorithmic Content and Engagement",
          "content": "We do not optimize our feeds for time spent alone, nor do we want to highlight extremist or harmful content. It's in our interest to minimize such content. Our content ranking is designed for value, not maximizing engagement at all costs. Users want positive and meaningful connections. The idea that we push controversial content for engagement is overstated and not aligned with our business incentives."
        },
        {
          "topic": "AR/VR Adoption Timeline and Use Cases",
          "content": "Quest 2 is a big step toward mainstream VR adoption. Factors like wireless form factor, diverse use cases (beyond gaming, including social experiences and productivity) will drive broader adoption. AR adoption requires glasses that look like normal eyewear—a huge technical challenge. Over time, as we solve these constraints, AR/VR can deliver entirely new social and productive experiences."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Creator Economy and Differentiation",
          "content": "We want to help millions of creators make a living. Our strengths: connecting creators with large audiences and enabling strong monetization through ads and commerce tools. By providing distribution and efficient monetization, we can stand out. While we’ll improve creative tools, distribution and monetization capabilities are where we can uniquely excel."

          "topic": "Impact of iOS 14 and Apple Privacy Changes",
          "content": "Small businesses rely heavily on personalized ads to reach interested customers. iOS 14 changes reduce data and may weaken targeting. While we’ll adapt and still deliver relative ROI, rebuilding effective targeting and measurement will take time. Our focus remains on providing valuable personalized ads while complying with evolving privacy regulations."

        {
          "topic": "Commerce and Consumer Experience",
          "content": "We’ve successfully launched Shops and have broad business adoption. Now we must improve the consumer side—making shopping seamless and integrated. Discovering products is easy on our platform, but we want users to shop natively. With better shopping experiences, we’ll move from top-of-funnel discovery to full-funnel transactions. Over time, features like AR try-on and integrated payment tools can further enhance the e-commerce experience."

          "topic": "Engagement, Video, and Competition",
          "content": "Overall engagement trends reflect both normalization post-COVID and the rise of video consumption, including Watch and Reels. Video can have fewer impressions per unit of time. Additionally, there’s competitive pressure. We remain focused on delivering value through a mix of content types and experiences."

          "topic": "iOS 14-5 Update and Mitigation",
          "content": "It’s early in the rollout. We remain concerned about the impact on SMBs and personalized advertising. We expect a headwind this year, but it’s manageable. We’re developing solutions like Aggregated Events Management to maintain good performance with less data. Strong ad demand also helps offset some impacts. Beyond IDFA, Apple’s ecosystem advantages (APIs, hardware) pose broader challenges."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Pricing and Auction Dynamics",
          "content": "Strong advertiser demand, particularly in commerce, drives higher auction prices. This isn’t just a COVID comp effect; on a two-year basis, pricing is strong. Essentially, high demand for our ads has led to improved prices. While Stories and Feed pricing differ, improvements in Stories’ DR performance are contributing positively."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Expense Outlook and Q1 Costs",
          "content": "Q1 expenses were lower due to factors like reduced marketing spend and prior-year bad debt provisions. We slightly raised our full-year expense guide, reflecting opportunities to invest in R&D (AR/VR, commerce, creators) and a return of some spending like marketing. We’ll continue investing in growth and innovation."
