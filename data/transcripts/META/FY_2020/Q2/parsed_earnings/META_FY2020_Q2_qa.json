          "topic": "E-commerce and Shops Strategy",
          "content": "For commerce, we're focusing on two main areas: Shops, which allow businesses to create a single online store across Facebook and Instagram, and messaging commerce, where people can connect with businesses directly through Messenger or WhatsApp. We aim to integrate Facebook Pay for seamless transactions and improve the full-funnel experience—from discovery to purchase—especially for small businesses. Over time, this should increase the value of our ad ecosystem."

        {
          "topic": "India and WhatsApp Commerce",
          "content": "India is a huge opportunity given WhatsApp’s large user base. We’re working to integrate commerce features so SMBs can transact directly in the app. Partnerships like the one with Jio can help onboard small retailers. Though rolling out payments has taken longer than expected, we remain optimistic that once resolved, India can serve as a template for other markets."

        {
          "topic": "Messaging Monetization Timeline",
          "content": "Messaging commerce and monetization through WhatsApp and Messenger are progressing. Click-to-messaging ads perform well, and business adoption of WhatsApp Business is growing fast. While it’s taking time to integrate payments and other features, we believe messaging will significantly contribute to revenue over the coming years, especially as more small businesses operate directly within these apps."

        {
          "topic": "Gaming and Community Building",
          "content": "Our approach to gaming—both for streaming and through VR—is about community. By integrating social features, we help creators build engaged communities. On VR, our investment is long term, and on the streaming side (e.g., the Mixer acquisition), we differentiate by fostering interaction and discovery. Gaming remains a promising growth area."

          "topic": "Advertising Environment: DR vs. Brand",
          "content": "We continue to see strong demand for measurable outcomes. Direct response ads perform well as businesses focus on immediate, measurable conversions. While brand advertising remains part of the mix, the trend is moving toward measurable performance across both large and small advertisers. The ability to deliver personalized ads and drive results is key to our value proposition."

        {
          "topic": "SMB Adoption and E-commerce Shift",
          "content": "SMBs are increasingly moving online due to the pandemic. We've seen growth in the number of businesses using our free tools—from 140 million to over 180 million—and now have over 9 million advertisers. As consumers stay home, SMBs rely on us to reach customers, set up storefronts, and use personalized ads. Shops is in early stages, feedback is good, and over the long term, commerce features will likely boost ad value more than direct fees."

          "topic": "Ad Revenue Trends and Outlook",
          "content": "After initial pullbacks in March/April, we’ve seen improvement. Direct response verticals like e-commerce and gaming led the rebound. Brand advertising is slower to recover. We guided to about 10% growth for July ad revenue and remain cautious about the second half due to macroeconomic uncertainty, potential changes in mobile operating systems (iOS 14), and the evolving pandemic."

        {
          "topic": "Global Variation and Fx Impact",
          "content": "In emerging markets (e.g., Rest of World), we faced currency headwinds and less representation from strong online verticals. Developed markets benefited from stimulus and higher e-commerce adoption. Foreign exchange and weaker macro conditions in certain regions affected growth."

        {
          "topic": "Remote Work Cost Dynamics",
          "content": "Long-term remote work is driven by talent access, not cost savings. There may be efficiencies (reduced office and travel) and added costs (more travel for gatherings, technology investments). It's too early to quantify. Our focus is on recruiting top talent globally rather than achieving immediate cost benefits."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Targeting and Measurement Headwinds",
          "content": "We remain concerned about regulatory and platform changes that limit targeting and measurement. Apple’s iOS 14 changes could reduce the effectiveness of personalized ads, impacting advertisers, especially small businesses. We’re working on solutions, but this remains a key challenge going into late 2020."
