            "content": "I believe it’s important to continue building and investing through this period, especially for small businesses (SMBs) who rely on our tools. Advertising is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, and while we can accept some margin reduction in the near term to keep investing, we understand the importance of maintaining high margins over time. We are committed to building tools that help SMBs transition online, discover new customers, and drive sales, which will also strengthen our long-term business."

Their vision is to help millions of small shops join a network that customers can access via WhatsApp. We’re building commerce tools like product catalogs and integrating payments so people can discover products, message businesses, and complete purchases seamlessly. While this is a major example in India, the technology and products we develop will be globally applicable. WhatsApp’s large user base and these new commerce features create significant long-term opportunities."

As a company, we must prepare for various outcomes and continue investing in tools and features that help people and businesses adapt, even in challenging times."

While it’s hard to isolate direct correlations, the surge in video chat and messaging contributes to overall ecosystem engagement. Providing more features and value to users across apps can indirectly drive increased activity in feed and Stories as well."

While VR is still a long-term vision, we’re pleased with Quest’s traction. We’d produce more units if we could and expect to accelerate our efforts in VR as part of the broader shift towards richer, more immersive communication experiences."

We rolled out a $100 million grants program and are building new features like fundraisers for small businesses. Longer term, our priority remains providing personalized advertising tools, free business Pages, and features like messaging and catalogs. These solutions help SMBs reach customers cost-effectively, which is crucial to their growth and, in turn, supports our ad business."

            "content": "Our ad auction is dynamic. During the pullback, we saw advertisers in categories like travel and auto reduce spending, but performance-driven and online-only advertisers, like those in gaming and e-commerce, stepped in to take advantage of lower prices. Most of our revenue comes from direct response ads, and their importance has grown during this period as businesses focus on online conversions. By offering a flexible auction, we enable advertisers who see ROI to keep spending, balancing the ecosystem."

            "topic": "Ad Trends and Vertical Performance",
            "content": "In late Q1, as the pandemic spread, we saw a broad-based pullback in advertising across large and small advertisers. Verticals like travel, auto, and certain brand advertisers slowed significantly. Gaming and some e-commerce advertisers fared better, benefiting from the auction’s dynamic nature and lower ad prices, which improved their ROIs. As we moved into Q2, these trends stabilized. Direct response and businesses that can sell online remain relatively resilient."

            "topic": "Regional and Vertical Insights",
            "content": "It's difficult to draw conclusions from early-affected markets like China since our user base there differs, and Chinese advertisers often focus on categories like gaming and e-commerce, which are performing better. The global business environment remains uncertain, and outcomes may vary by region and vertical. We’ll continue to monitor these trends."

            "content": "We recorded a $193 million increase in bad debt expense related to COVID-19, reflecting collectability concerns. We’re also finding efficiencies—reduced travel, leveraging lower marketing costs, and slowing certain hiring areas. While we continue to invest in product and engineering teams, we’re more cautious with business functions. This balanced approach maintains our commitment to innovation while managing costs."

            "topic": "Targeting and Measurement Headwinds",
            "content": "Pre-COVID regulatory and platform-driven changes to targeting and measurement persist. GDPR, CCPA, and platform policy changes reduce third-party signal availability. Our own privacy tools (like off-Facebook activity controls) also impact targeting. While these challenges remain overshadowed by the pandemic’s effects right now, they still represent a long-term headwind. Having strong first-party data positions us relatively well, but businesses may find it harder to acquire customers efficiently, affecting growth."
