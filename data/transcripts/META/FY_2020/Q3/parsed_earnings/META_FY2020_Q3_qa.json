          "topic": "User Behavior Changes and Product Priorities",
          "content": "With COVID, we've seen an increase in synchronous connection (voice/video calls), community interactions, and online commerce. People continue to spend time in video and gaming. While some initial usage spikes have normalized, community building and commerce remain areas of long-term opportunity. Our product roadmap will emphasize these shifts, focusing on features that help businesses move online and people stay connected."

        {
          "topic": "AR/VR Roadmap and Milestones",
          "content": "Our goal is to establish VR and AR as the next computing platform. For VR, reaching around 10 million active units is key to driving a self-sustaining ecosystem for developers. AR glasses remain a few years out, with significant technical hurdles to achieve a socially acceptable form factor. We’re also building a ‘spatial computing’ operating system and integrating AR effects into apps, which will aid in long-term AR/VR adoption."

        {
          "topic": "Messaging Commerce and Monetization",
          "content": "We’re building a commerce platform around messaging. Click-to-messaging ads are showing good traction, and integrating Facebook Shops into WhatsApp and Messenger will let people discover and transact within threads. Payments and messaging tools will support small businesses and further our long-term revenue potential in messaging."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Interoperability of Messaging Apps",
          "content": "We started rolling out interoperability between Messenger and Instagram Direct. Over time, we aim to connect Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp so people can choose their preferred app and still connect across our ecosystem. This integration simplifies communication and makes it easier for businesses to reach customers in one unified system."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Gaming Ecosystem and Competition",
          "content": "Gaming is a big growth area, and we differentiate by fostering communities and social discovery. We’re combining video, communities, and cloud infrastructure to support both creators and users. Long-term, VR and AR will also play a role in gaming. We’re optimistic about gaming as a major opportunity going forward."

          "topic": "Commerce Acceleration and Advertiser Growth",
          "content": "The shift online is driving businesses to move from offline to online presence rapidly. We now have about 200 million businesses on our free tools and 10 million advertisers. As businesses embrace online tools, personalized ads become more valuable. This has accelerated ad revenue, as more advertisers invest in measurable, performance-based ad formats."

          "topic": "Verticals and SMB Adoption",
          "content": "E-commerce, education, and retail verticals are adopting online channels faster. Though verticals like travel and auto lagged, they’re starting to rebound. SMBs, in particular, rely on us to pivot online—using our free tools for presence and personalized ads for customer acquisition. This drives long-term advertiser growth despite challenging times."

          "topic": "2021 Expense Outlook",
          "content": "We anticipate expense growth in 2021 due to continued hiring in product and engineering roles, AR/VR, messaging, commerce, and anticipated higher operational costs as offices reopen and travel resumes. This reflects the broad set of opportunities we see, rather than a prediction of revenue growth."
        },
        {
          "topic": "IDFA and iOS14 Impact",
          "content": "The delay in Apple’s iOS14 privacy changes postpones the impact but doesn’t reduce it. We still expect significant challenges once these changes take effect, affecting app install ads and Audience Network. While we’re exploring ways to mitigate these headwinds, it remains a substantial factor in 2021."
        },
        {
          "topic": "Capital Allocation",
          "content": "Our focus remains on investing in growth and strategic initiatives like FRL and commerce. Share repurchases continue under board authorization. Changes in potential tax policies won’t fundamentally alter our capital allocation strategy. We aim to build long-term value and maintain flexibility."

        {
          "topic": "Top Advertisers and Broad Base of Support",
          "content": "No update on top advertiser concentration, but we continue to see strong SMB-driven growth. We remain pleased with the breadth of our advertiser base. Political ads remain a low single-digit percentage of revenue, not a top vertical."
