          "topic": "Interoperability of Messaging Services",
          "content": "Messenger and WhatsApp will remain distinct as they serve different user expectations and have different levels of complexity. WhatsApp will remain more utilitarian and simple, while Messenger will continue offering more expressive features. Over time, we’ll enable interoperability so people can choose their preferred messaging app and still reach everyone."

          "content": "We want to support more meaningful and durable communities beyond just feeds and basic group features. Over time, we’ll add more tools to help organizations and local communities build stronger connections. While groups and communities already contribute significantly to engagement and indirectly to monetization, we see further potential for meaningful services that can help them become more robust ‘community institutions’ on our platforms."

          "content": "We launched the Instagram Shop tab in Q4. It’s early, but we’re pleased with initial results. Instagram Shopping helps businesses, both large and small, connect with people and move from product discovery to purchase. By integrating commerce features, we aim to create a seamless experience for both consumers and advertisers."

          "content": "Small businesses depend on personalized ads to reach interested customers. Restrictions like those in iOS 14 and IDFA may limit their ability to target effectively, risking a significant reduction in sales. We’re concerned about how these changes will impact SMBs and the broader economic growth they drive."

We introduced branded content tags and shopping in Reels. Ads will come later, once the product is more established and we can ensure a good experience for users and advertisers."

          "content": "Q4 was exceptionally strong due to the shift to online commerce and product spending. As we move through 2021, we’ll face tougher comps, especially in the second half. Factors include possible reversion of consumer spending from products back to services, as well as privacy-related headwinds (iOS 14) affecting ad targeting."

          "topic": "IDFA and iOS 14 Changes",
          "content": "Our view on iOS 14 hasn’t changed. We still expect it to be a headwind as Apple’s policies will require user permission for third-party data usage. High opt-out rates will reduce ad targeting efficacy. While Audience Network will be hit hardest, the impact will also be felt across our core ads business on iOS. Over time, commerce initiatives and on-site conversion tools may help mitigate some effects."

Over time, we’ll continue investing in ad products to better serve service-based verticals. With 10 million advertisers as of last quarter, we remain focused on broadening our appeal and tools to suit various advertiser needs."
