          "topic": "Investment Cycle for AI and Reality Labs",
          "content": "It's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from previous cycles. Typically, it takes a couple of years, maybe more or less, to build out and scale products before focusing on monetization. Smart investors recognize when a product is scaling and has a clear monetizable opportunity even before revenue materializes. We've seen this with Reels and Stories, where scaling initially wasn't profitable but became so over time. Currently, with Meta AI launching in a meaningful way, we're focused on growing the product and its engagement, confident that if it scales well, it will become a significant business."

For businesses, this means facilitating sales, commerce, and customer support through AI, reducing the cost of engaging with customers. For creators, AI agents can handle interactions, allowing them to focus on their creative endeavors. These AI agents are expected to drive significant engagement and monetization as they scale."

While we're not directly competing with search advertising, there may be opportunities to integrate ads and paid content within Meta AI interactions over time. Additionally, as Meta AI scales, there could be further monetization opportunities through premium features and business messaging enhancements."

This architecture will be extended to other video recommendation areas, aiming to unlock more relevant content recommendations over time. On the ad side, our Meta Lattice model consolidates specialized models into larger ones, improving ad performance across various services and objectives. We expect to enhance these models further in 2024 to support more conversion types and drive continued ad performance improvements."
