As Meta AI continues to grow in value for users, we anticipate a broadening set of queries, including those with commercial intent. Regarding building our own in-house search offering, we currently integrate with leading search engine partners like Bing and Google to provide sources for Meta AI's responses. We believe in leveraging these partnerships to enhance user experience without directly competing with established search providers."
