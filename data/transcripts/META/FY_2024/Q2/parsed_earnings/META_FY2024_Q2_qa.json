          "topic": "Investment Cycle for AI and Reality Labs",
          "content": "It's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from previous cycles. Typically, it takes a couple of years, maybe more or less, to build out and scale products before focusing on monetization. Smart investors recognize when a product is scaling and has a clear monetizable opportunity even before revenue materializes. We've seen this with Reels and Stories, where scaling initially wasn't profitable but became so over time. Currently, with Meta AI launching in a meaningful way, we're focused on growing the product and its engagement, confident that if it scales well, it will become a significant business."
