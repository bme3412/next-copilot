When you look at the trends of this past year like that wonderful Honeywell story that Marc mentioned in his script, they shifted 7,000 salespeople from in-person to virtual customer meetings. Customer meetings aren't going back to conference rooms only. They're going to stay on Zoom as companies like ours just realize that we can execute as well as ever before in this digital environment..."

When we talk about the fact that of the seven-figure deals, they on average included more than four of our clouds; we're not selling individual products. We're selling a Customer 360 solution to really transform the entire customer experience..."

Probably the easiest part on that is the difference in T&E. That clearly has gone way down. We are assuming, for purposes of guidance, some modest return of travel in the second half of this year. But it will be nowhere near where we were pre-pandemic..."

I was hoping you could parse out what customers are asking for, what cloud application could see the highest uptick in interest as you look at the pipeline. You mentioned Tableau being a meaningful part of the large deal pipeline. But would love to just better understand what cloud applications specifically are revving the most here in this kind of post-vaccine era that we're entering?"

Can you talk to us about – does that come from sort of expenses being pushed out? Or is there actual kind of more efficiencies that you're finding in the business that enable you to raise the operating margin guide here?"
