          "The team has done a spectacular job doing a soft landing, not to use an overused term with respect to the economy. So that's cost controls, operating discipline, et cetera. So really congratulations on that. And I hope that Dreamforce continues to stay in San Francisco, Marc. A question for you is we got all this tremendous new product excitement. We've got generative AI capabilities. The spending environment seems to be sort of stabilizing. The economy does have a soft landing. Do you think Salesforce has maximized its customer wallet share? Or do you think there's more share to gain and therefore, there are better days ahead? Because we've seen the margin story play out very, very impressively. Is there -- is sales -- can Salesforce get back to the days of growth, not hyper growth, but is there enough room in the market, enough customer wallet share? And seemingly there's enough product excitement with generative AI. So if you net it all out, can we still do a nice job with margins while still having a shot at growing even faster when economic conditions are no longer a constraint. Congratulations."

But just any other factors we should keep in mind that may create a challenge over the next couple of months."
