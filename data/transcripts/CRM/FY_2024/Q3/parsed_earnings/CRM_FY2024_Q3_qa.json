And I was just wondering if you could talk about if we should view that as a harbinger of more interest in the broader Data Cloud offering, and whether the interest in MuleSoft is also sort of a harbinger of -- just more interest in AI as people try to get their data estates in order to get ready for this coming AI wave?"

Really early in a technology cycle, because a lot of what we're hearing is a lot of exploration out there, a lot of people trying to figure out what to do with these tools, not a lot of buying. So can you give us a little bit of color on kind of what's driving that adoption and what's enabled you guys to get such good adoption so quickly? And maybe if I could sneak one in for Amy as well. Great margin expansion this year, but there's a lot of stuff you guys need to be investing against with this technology cycle. Should we expect to see further margin expansion as we head into FY '25?"

We are now starting to hear from hyperscalers that the optimizations are attenuating. Do you sense that a shift in mentality spilling over a little into the thought process, for example, for Sales Cloud seats or perhaps some excitement sparked by Sales GPT and freeing up some budget there on GenAI that maybe wasn't there 6 months ago?"
