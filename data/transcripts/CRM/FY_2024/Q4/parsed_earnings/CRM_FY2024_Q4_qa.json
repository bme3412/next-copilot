Really early in a technology cycle, because a lot of what we're hearing is a lot of exploration out there, a lot of people trying to figure out what to do with these tools, not a lot of buying. So can you give us a little bit of color on kind of what's driving that adoption and what's enabled you guys to get such good adoption so quickly? And maybe if I could sneak one in for Amy as well. Great margin expansion this year, but there's a lot of stuff you guys need to be investing against with this technology cycle. Should we expect to see further margin expansion as we head into FY '25?"

I'm just wondering if you're -- are they suddenly becoming more productive or able to do more with less already?"

And then also on the pro services side, typically not a focus area for anybody on this call, but down 9% in the quarter was obviously an inflection down. What's happening with that? Is that tight discretionary spend? Or is that Salesforce consciously pushing more work to your SI partners?"

A, it's clear Data Cloud is optimized for customer data and customer-related apps. Can you take it beyond that? And then, B, how much of the customer base today is really viable to take Einstein 1 on and UE+ at a 50% higher list price point? And how far penetrated are we into that?"
