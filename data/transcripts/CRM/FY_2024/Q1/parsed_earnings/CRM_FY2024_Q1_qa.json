Are you going to look to go back to that kind of Co-CEO dynamic, or replace kind of what he was doing on a day-to-day basis with some other executive on a go-forward basis?",

Any change in that dynamic, given kind of what's going on in the macro environment, and seeing kind of the degradation on the top line? Does that push operating margin? Does that sort of push operating margin expansion to kind of the forefront in any way?"

My question is, we think of all these actions that you're taking as drivers of margin expansion. But are you starting to see some early traction here on the sales productivity front, such that perhaps that's driving some upside here across the business, perhaps larger deals now that you're seeing coming out of the field and pipeline and some of the deal closure?"

          "What an amazing end of fiscal year. Congratulations to the team. Much, much better than expected. Brighter days ahead. Question for Marc. And maybe, Brian, you can chime in here. So Marc, we went through the 2008, 2009 recession, 2010 rebound, back then, the company was a smaller company, but you still were able to get profitability up. We went through a bit of a downturn, and we came out of it. So are there pyramids to be drawn in this cycle? Because there's certainly uncertainty about recession, whatnot, that's damping spending. If we take that as a fact, the growth rate that you guided to, should that be the aspirational long-term growth rate of the company? Or do you think if and when the recession clears that there should be a rebound in spending? And we understand that all the go-to-market rationalization that you and Brian and Amy you're all working on should allow you to gain share. So help us think about the recovery curve of Salesforce in the next economic cycle."
