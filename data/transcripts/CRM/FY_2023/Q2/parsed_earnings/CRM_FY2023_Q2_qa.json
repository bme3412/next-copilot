Is it the vertical solutions or something in particular that has really reinvigorated that line item?",

Can you talk to us a little bit about those initiatives that are enabling better operating margins?

Is there something programmatic that's enabling you guys to drive that better operating margin on a go-forward basis?"

Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of client prioritization in terms of certain projects, because I do remember from the old times that the front office always had higher priority because it’s revenue generating, etc.?

What would you do to turn around the Data Cloud? I know, clearly, it has had some very significant momentum, but I can, in some sense, look at the new guidance versus the old and say a lot of that delta is basically the slowdown in the growth rate in the Data Cloud that is the Tableau and MuleSoft business. Brian, I wanted to get your opinion on that. And as the Management Team, as you talk to customers—and, Marc, you’ve been through these cycles before—what are customers saying as to when they might re-engage at the same level of enthusiasm with Salesforce, be it deal size or close rate? What are the things that they’re looking from a macro perspective or leading indicators in their business, so it could be back to re-engaging the way they used to re-engage with Salesforce? Thank you so much."

Slack again outperformed revenue expectations, and, obviously, the large deal metrics are impressive, too, but what’s driving the continued demand for Slack, let’s say, relative to some of these other vendors that are heavier in the telephony or the video segments of UCaaS, that, frankly, have been delivering weaker results? Are you seeing strong, call it, standalone demand for Slack as a horizontal messaging platform, or are the Salesforce integrations that you highlighted driving more attach as a collaboration hub of Slack in the context of multi-cloud deployments? Thanks."
