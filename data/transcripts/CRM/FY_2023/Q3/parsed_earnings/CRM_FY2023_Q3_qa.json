I guess the good news is there's already a CEO, in you, set to go. But should we expect a replacement for Bret on a going-forward basis? Are you going to look to go back to that kind of Co-CEO dynamic, or replace kind of what he was doing on a day-to-day basis with some other executive on a go-forward basis?",

Any change in that dynamic, given kind of what's going on in the macro environment, and seeing kind of the degradation on the top line? Does that push operating margin? Does that sort of push operating margin expansion to kind of the forefront in any way?"
