Is it the vertical solutions or something in particular that has really reinvigorated that line item?",

Can you talk to us a little bit about those initiatives that are enabling better operating margins? There's some speculation in the press about maybe slower headcount growth or some culling of expenses. Is there something programmatic that's enabling you guys to drive that better operating margin on a go-forward basis?"

Everyone is wondering if that guidance probably now reflects a little bit more conservatism given the more uneven macro backdrop. Could you just comment on that a little bit, maybe versus where we were 90 days ago?"

What are customers telling you right now in terms of where they are in their journeys there in terms of transformation? Also, we've seen some big contracts signed from contact center vendors kind of along this theme, too.
