I think that, number one, it's been pretty magical to use OpenAI over the last year, especially in the last release, when I'm really talking to it. And when I think about the incredible engineering effort that OpenAI has done, it's pretty awesome. They've built a great UI. I love talking to the software. They have really strong algorithms or what we call Models, especially their new one, which is their 4o Model.

Absolutely right, we want to get aligned behind our go-to-market strategy around buyer to make sure that we're aligned to support our customer scale, that we can really support our multi-cloud strategy going forward to ensure our customers know exactly what we can do to support them across our entire product portfolio..."

In terms of materiality in the short term, you're not going to really see it show up. We did in the second half of last year. And so while we've seen great progress and there's a lot of promise for it, in terms of this year's revenue guide, not a huge factor in our growth numbers this year. You will see it start to show up in year 2 and 3 as we roll through the renewals, the uplift, et cetera, and some of the incremental pricing changes that we're going to do."

I think the way to think about the price uplift moving to Einstein 1 addition used to be a limited edition plus, is really about the value that we're providing to our customers because at the end of the day, our ability to get increased price is about the value that we're going to provide. And so as customers start to ramp up their abilities on AI, ramp up their learnings and understand what it means for them economically, our ability to get price will be dictated by that..."

But the quarter did come in below your expectations for CRPO growth, and we all look at that as a forward indicator, but you're not taking down the full year revenue guidance. So I was hoping you could help us get comfortable on why that's not leaving risk on the table and why you guys feel comfortable that original fiscal year '25 guide is still appropriate. Like, why not take it down and make it more conservative and ensure that we can get back to beat and raise quarters on a go-forward basis?"

I wonder if you could just articulate a little bit on that. What are those changes? Is this the kind of situation where it's just some short-term impact that could benefit the sales productivity over the longer term?"

Just curious, when will that be a needle mover for revenues? How much of that uplift are you baking into the guide this year? And then also on the pro services side, typically not a focus area for anybody on this call, but down 9% in the quarter was obviously an inflection down. What's happening with that? Is that tight discretionary spend? Or is that Salesforce consciously pushing more work to your SI partners?"

I'm just wondering if you're -- are they suddenly becoming more productive or able to do more with less already?"

A, it's clear Data Cloud is optimized for customer data and customer-related apps. Can you take it beyond that? And then, B, how much of the customer base today is really viable to take Einstein 1 on and UE+ at a 50% higher list price point? And how far penetrated are we into that?"
