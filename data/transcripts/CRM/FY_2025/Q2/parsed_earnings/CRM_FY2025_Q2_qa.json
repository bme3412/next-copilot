It is all about growth, and it's all about innovation, and those are 2 of our specialties here at Salesforce. So I think when we think about growth, for the last 25 years, I'd say we're mostly focused on selling our apps and doing the services around those. And we're going to continue to sell our apps, and we are, and you can see in the quarter, we sold a lot of apps. And not just selling our apps, but also we're selling our Data Cloud as well. And now we're selling our agents. And not just as core platforms, but also through our verticals, which have been some of our highest performing capabilities in the company. And you're also right that there are international regions that are growing at incredible rates. And we see that in Asia. And we also see that in other parts of the world as well, where we continue to see like this double-digit growth. And that has been very inspiring to us. So it's really a combination of these 3 things. The total transformation of the technology stack, the verticalization of that stack and that international growth is 3 really core levers of growth, in my mind, I'm going to turn it over to Brian to give you the detail."

            "topic": "Pricing Strategy and Agentforce",
            "content": "And then number two, on pricing. When you think about -- when you think about apps and you think about humans, because humans use apps, not in all cases. So for example, the Data Cloud is a consumption product. The Commerce Cloud is a consumption product. Of course, the e-mail product, Marketing Cloud is a consumption product. Heroku is a consumption product. So of course, we've had nonhuman consumption-based products for quite a long time at Salesforce. But in this idea of agents, when -- I'll just give you my own personal goals. So I'm not giving any guidance here. My goal is that by the end of fiscal year '26 that we will have 1 billion agents. Already in just looking at the number of consumers identified just in the trials that we have going on, we have like 100 million identified or more. Okay. call it, 200 million. But the funny thing is, of course, it's only 1 agent. But let's just think it's like a manifestation of all these agents talking to all these consumers. And then when we look at pricing, it will be on a consumption basis. And when we think about that, we think about saying to our customers, and we have, it's about $2 per conversation. So that is kind of how we think about it, that we're going to have a lot of agents out there, even though it's only 1 agent. It's a very high margin opportunity, as you can imagine, and we're going to be reaching -- look, you have to think about these agents are like, this is the new website. This is your new phone number. This is how your customers are going to be connecting with you in this new way, and we're going to be helping our customers to manage these conversations. And it's probably a per conversational charge as a good way to look at it or we're selling additional consumption credits like we do with our data cloud. So it's a very exciting moment, and I'll turn it over to Brian as well."

            "content": "Great. Keith, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. Let me start by saying that there are many factors we have to consider within our guidance. And all in, based on what we're seeing at this time, we continue to believe that we will be within the range we guided. Now any guide, that is a balancing act. And as Brian called out, we are continuing to see this measured buying behavior. It's really been very consistent for the last 2 full years at this point with the possible exception of Q4 where we did see stronger bookings. And you can see the impact of that environment on our Q1 numbers. There's no question about that. ProServ also continues to see more and more pressure as customers are really just looking for shorter duration projects. However, this is really balanced by the demand that we are seeing in our products, and that remains strong. We continue to see good demand on multi-cloud adoption. We're seeing benefits from pricing and packaging changes that we have rolled out over the past year. We're seeing very healthy adoption around our industries projects. I also should point out that our attrition rate remains very healthy. Customers are continuing to rely on Salesforce to run their businesses, and they'll continue to do that. So when I step back and really take a holistic view of the full year. We do feel confident that we will be within our guidance range."

And again, that's what you're seeing in Q1 and this year. And then the second stage, which is really as we've been going through this comprehensive operating and go-to-market review, that review is going to enable the second phase of our transformation, and that's something that's going to be ongoing and long term over the next few years..."

On some of the gen AI, it's still early. And given the adoption curve, as really our size and scale as a $38 billion company, we're not factoring in a material contribution from these new products into our FY '25 revenue guidance at this time. Turning on op margin. Yes, really happy to see another 200 basis points this year as a commitment. This year, we are just seeing amazing leverage from many of the hard decisions we made last year. They're continuing to flow through and really benefiting the business. A few things I would call out, a lot of discipline around headcount over the past year. We are starting to grow in some areas at this point, but it's really investing into our most productive areas, AI and data. And we're doing that in a cost-effective way, really trying to leverage areas that have high, high talent pools and low cost. We're also looking at things like top line. How are we doing with our product and pricing? What are we doing in terms of go-to-market efficiencies? Brian has been great this past year in making changes and drive on productivity. I think you'll see additional changes coming -- digital benefits coming from all of those areas."

We are going to continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale. We are going to invest in innovation. As Marc said, that is organic and it can be inorganic, if it matches our principles and our goals. And we're going to return cash to shareholders, and we're doing that now both through our share repurchase program and our dividend program. Now on the inorganic perspective, as you brought up, we're always going to be opportunistic. M&A has been an incredible part of our past. I'm sure at the right time, it will be part of our future. But it's got to fit into the framework that we have been outlining for the last few days. We're going to have to have a time line to value accretion. We're going to need to prioritize our use of the balance sheet, and it's got to be a best-in-class asset. And when all that comes together, that's what we'll be focused on. In the meantime, I really want to talk about our goal, we are trying to optimize shareholder value. At the end of the day, that's the single most important element. And we're doing that by focusing on delivering very strong free cash flow per share. We're doing this by our focus on profitable growth and by very carefully managing our dilution. When you bring that together, I am very confident in our long-term free cash flow per share opportunity and very confident about our capital allocation strategy overall."

            "topic": "Growth Equation and AI Contribution",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question, Keith. And I appreciate your knowledge of all of our growth strategies here around multi-cloud deals and international acceleration, product and pricing. I think it's important not to lose track of the fact that these new innovations around Agentforce and Data Cloud and AI and make all of our core apps that much better. And even in the context of Service Cloud that you're referencing here, our customers are looking at their all-in cost of running a call center. And when you bring a technology that allows you to scale and drive efficiencies in operating that call center, and it's on our technology we're excited about those conversations because we think we get to monetize all of that incredible innovation through the all-in cost there. There are a couple of other things I think you should know about, certainly, our channel diversification as we think about scale and international business either through resellers, a big upside for us, I believe, is our AWS Marketplace is a driver going forward. I mentioned in the comments earlier that 3 of our top 10 deals went through the marketplace. So a big opportunity there. And then maybe another one that we haven't talked as much about, but is a big focus for us as we get into the second half of this year and beyond is how do we look at managing our attrition more aggressively going forward as a way to drive growth? How do we make sure that we are driving more adoption, more feature usage, more value derived from our technology to deliver more value to customers so that they get growth off of and efficiencies using our technology? And so many inputs, you know many of them. But as Marc said, this is a new era, and we're excited about the future and the value we can deliver to our customers."

It's the most obvious time to make those changes when you start out a new year. These changes are actually intended to be productivity drivers for the future. Absolutely right, we want to get aligned behind our go-to-market strategy around buyer to make sure that we're aligned to support our customer scale, that we can really support our multi-cloud strategy going forward to ensure our customers know exactly what we can do to support them across our entire product portfolio. And some of the changes that we made were exactly for that reason, how do we ensure that we are aligned behind that strategy to ensure we can go faster in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So you're absolutely right, the changes, while impactful in Q1 are short term, and we expect to see productivity gains from them going forward."

But there are other pockets around the world that were very strong. Canada was a strong region for us in the quarter. I mentioned our Japan business really accelerated in the quarter, really outstanding performance from our Japan business. So the big businesses are going to feel the impact, obviously, of the measured buying environment. In the Americas, more exposure to technology, which I think we all know has been a tough industry over the last several quarters. SMB and other areas, the transactional business, these are the areas where we're going to feel some of those headwinds in the business. So spot-on, EMEA and America sort of feeling the impacts of the measured environments."

            "content": "Brad, thanks for the question. I think the way to think about the price uplift moving to Einstein 1 addition used to be a limited edition plus, is really about the value that we're providing to our customers because at the end of the day, our ability to get increased price is about the value that we're going to provide. And so as customers start to ramp up their abilities on AI, ramp up their learnings and understand what it means for them economically, our ability to get price will be dictated by that. Early signs of that are pretty strong. We feel good about the progress we've seen. It's only been in market for 4-plus months now in FY '24, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing. But at the end of the day, we're trying to make it as simple as we can for our customers to buy it, but it's going to be predicated on the value."

          "Congratulations on a really solid quarter. And Amy, really heartbroken see you going. It's been great working with you over the past 4 years as CFO. You've done an amazing job in the role. Two-part question. One on sort of the growth equation for Salesforce. A lot of excitement around the generative AI and the new AI capabilities and expanding portfolio there. We're all really excited about. There's a lot of other parts of the equation that are adding to growth, whether it's industry cloud or international expansion or multi-cloud solution. And maybe a question for Brian. Can you help us understand how to build up the growth equation? Like where are you guys getting those points of growth? And when does GenAI become a more material contributor there? And then the second question is around pricing. With agents coming into the picture with productivity gains of 90% deflection rates, investors are going to worry about the number of seats being used coming down with those productivity gains, how does the pricing change to account for that? So Salesforce still get the value from these solutions on a go-forward basis?"

I wonder if you could just articulate a little bit on that. What are those changes?

Maybe it's just cyclical, maybe high interest rates, causing economic uncertainty, maybe it's as simple as that. Or maybe it's structural. And if it's structural, maybe there's an architectural change going on. Marc, you drove the last big architectural change from distributed computing to internet computing. How confident you are that this generative AI, which is causing an upheaval in that whole tech stack, is not something to take lightly? And what are the things that the company is preparing, if it's not just cyclical or maybe the structural change that's going on, what are the things that you are doing to the company to bulletproof? Because typically, incumbents miss big transitions, right? You and I have seen that. We've all seen that. What are the things you're doing to ensure that you're bulletproof in that regard that you're absolutely ready architecturally for the next cycle?"
