And if you could just share with us some examples of how it's helping you expand your reach within your existing customers and any success you might be able to share about how it's brought new customers into the Salesforce fold. And then I just had a quick follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Just -- you mentioned the cRPO that you -- the headwinds in the quarter from FX. Were you expecting -- could you share with us the -- were you expecting an FX headwind in the quarter for cRPO? Because that's where we're getting things as well."

I think everybody on this call realizes that it's -- there's a little bit more macro uncertainty out there, but I wanted to ask whether as you and Keith and Mark Hawkins sat down to set the guide for 2Q and the full year, whether you're assuming any broader spending environment change for Salesforce?"

        "Great. I guess for Keith, head count adds in the quarter were quite strong for Q1 and up 24% on a year-over-year basis. It's almost the highest in 2 years. So are there any areas you would highlight you're accelerating investments whether at certain function, geography or product area? And I guess as a follow-up, since you're getting so large and almost 40,000 employees, can you just touch on how you ensure -- you continue to manage onboarding and attrition and maybe how attrition is tracking these days?"

        "Keith, I actually wanted to follow up on your comments around My Trailhead, especially as it relates to the comment you had on Accenture. Can My Trailhead become a force multiplier for you from a go-to-market perspective, especially in places like Europe and Asia where you might not had the reach historically? It seems to me that, that could be a potential way for you guys to accelerate even faster in those markets where you have the demand but maybe not the people on the ground to go capture the demand. So I would love just kind of your thoughts on that."

I'd love to hear beyond just what is happening and what are you doing with renewals, but what is the broader strategy as you go to market? And this is probably a good question for Keith. As you think about the role of renewals and customer success with respect to the broader portfolio, how do you approach that customer? And is that philosophy changing at all?"

        "Two really quick ones. Maybe first for Marc, you mentioned some Salesforce reorganization and the fact of them having impact on current RPO this quarter. Can you maybe touch on what kind of reorgs or what are you doing this year from a strategic go-to-market perspective around the sales team that's a little different from last year? And then maybe just given the continuous mention around Trailhead and talent as being important strategic differentiators, have you given any thought to expanding your role in the talent kind of market from organic or inorganic manner?"

Is it 7-, 8-figure deals? Or are certain cloud products more likely to be pulled through? Or a cash because of a Customer 360 conversation? I just wanted to learn some more perspective on that."
