I mean you mentioned reacceleration in several clouds, and that's the one that really jumped out to us. We've seen in the past couple of quarters, 17% this quarter. Can you double click on what's really driving that? I mean that's the highest growth rate we've seen in Sales Cloud for 4 quarters now. And also maybe talk about how Vlocity will figure into that, too."

But I was wondering, Marc, if you could share with us a little bit of the initial feedback on Tableau from customers. Has there been anything that surprised you in terms of how customers are leveraging it? And I'm also wondering to the extent you are seeing people who are obviously running it on-premise, to the extent you're starting to hear customers talk about being able to leverage that data that's on-premise and bring it into your various cloud offerings."

          "Keith, it's been a pleasure working with you and definitely leaving on a high note after this Q4, which definitely seemed very strong. Two questions, one, in terms of kind of the strength in the overall business. Given kind of what we've been seeing over the past couple of days in the stock market and with the coronavirus, any indication that that's impacting demand at all for Salesforce heading into your guys' FY '21? Then the second question maybe for Mr. Benioff. With Keith leaving, is there any changes you have to make to -- on the leadership structure or anything that you have to do in terms of bringing in new management to fill in for the functionality that you could bring in the role?"

          "I'll add to the course of best wishes for Keith in your next endeavors. I had 2 questions, but they're related, one, just a quick 1 for Mark Hawkins. You gave us the revenue impact for Vlocity, but I'd be curious what the margin impact from that transaction was. And then more broadly, the second part is at Analyst Day 3 months ago, there was discussion around taking time to digest between deals. Tableau officially, officially closed 3 months ago, where you got the go-ahead to integrate. Now we're seeing another acquisition. It's not as big as Tableau, but it's certainly not a small one either. I'm just curious to get an update on where the mindset is on M&A going forward from here."
