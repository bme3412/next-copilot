          "Congrats on a superb quarter. Marc, I wanted to ask you, we're witnessing such a bifurcation in the retailers' results this year. We have seen companies like Target and Walmart and Home Depot doing well. And at the same time, it seems like Amazon is hurting some of the others, whether it be Sears or Barney's or Nordstrom or the GAP or others. I'm wondering if you're finding the retailers that adopted Demandware are actually competing better? And then -- and just -- is this retail apocalypse kind of causing companies in other industries to want to adopt Salesforce a little bit faster so that they don't get Amazon-ed or Uber-ized?"

          "I mean, Marc, you've been one of the most strategic visionaries in the software market over the last 2 decades. And obviously, you've built one of the biggest cloud companies to date through a combination of internal R&D and M&A. And I guess that's where my questions would lie. Can you share with us your vision for M&A as you look ahead? And how you think, especially now that you've kind of gotten into the on-premise market as well, how you think about the marriage of the -- your -- the cloud footprint and the on-premise footprint? And I guess the other question that we get asked a lot about and I'm sure others do on the line is how do you think about the margin trade-off that come with that bigger TAM? And given Mark Hawkins talked about it on the call, the fiscal '23 target, are there any thoughts of maybe ever adding a margin target to the (inaudible) and organic number? So I guess that's where my focus is."

        "questions": [
          "I'd like to first applaud the company for the tremendous amount of clarity and the straightforwardness of how you report your financials such as the organic versus the acquired, the currency impact. You go through excruciating detail to make it abundantly clear how your core business is doing, particularly the fact that margins are projected to grow, excluding the acquisitions, more than you anticipated. So I just want to give you a round of applause on the clarity and the straightforwardness of the disclosure. Now the question for you Marc, as you move ahead, you're targeting a $28-plus billion revenue company. With the diversity of end markets that we've just simply not seen in software, the product end logs and the on-prem work, whether it's SAP or Oracle, it just didn't quite have the diversity of end markets that Salesforce.com is pursuing. So as you plan to roughly double revenues, how does the go-to-market nature of how you're going -- how does the go-to-market strategy evolve as you attack the breadth and complexity of markets that were simply just not seen? And there's no recipe to follow."

          "Great. I guess for Keith, head count adds in the quarter were quite strong for Q1 and up 24% on a year-over-year basis. It's almost the highest in 2 years. So are there any areas you would highlight you're accelerating investments whether at certain function, geography or product area? And I guess as a follow-up, since you're getting so large and almost 40,000 employees, can you just touch on how you ensure -- you continue to manage onboarding and attrition and maybe how attrition is tracking these days?"

          "Keith, I actually wanted to follow up on your comments around My Trailhead, especially as it relates to the comment you had on Accenture. Can My Trailhead become a force multiplier for you from a go-to-market perspective, especially in places like Europe and Asia where you might not had the reach historically? It seems to me that, that could be a potential way for you guys to accelerate even faster in those markets where you have the demand but maybe not the people on the ground to go capture the demand. So I would love just kind of your thoughts on that."

I'd love to hear beyond just what is happening and what are you doing with renewals, but what is the broader strategy as you go to market? And this is probably a good question for Keith. As you think about the role of renewals and customer success with respect to the broader portfolio, how do you approach that customer? And is that philosophy changing at all?"

And in addition, you're doing really well in decision support with Einstein. And then the other third area that's really hot these days is this whole robotic process automation. So the question I have maybe for Marc is -- because you're -- you think about these things, is how do you see Salesforce participating in each of those 3 markets? Because it sure seems to me that those 3 technologies are going to have to work closer with each other over time because I just feel like they're going to intersect. And so how does Salesforce position itself for that kind of next wave of those 3 things kind of connecting with each other?"

What do you view as sort of core competencies that need to be set by global leadership versus providing regional leadership with the flexibility to make the changes or run the business in a way that they see is most appropriate on the ground in that market?"
