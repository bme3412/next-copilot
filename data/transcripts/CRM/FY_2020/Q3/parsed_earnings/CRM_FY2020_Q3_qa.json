So relative to the 22% organic CRPO performance you put up in 3Q, which was terrific, the 16% guide for 4Q feels a little bit light. So you just touched on perhaps one explanation. Is it possible to quantify how big that impact was and if there are other factors maybe driving your guidance for that 16% number, maybe being a little extra careful, given macro or maybe there was some contract duration changes?"

Marc, we've noticed over the past 18 months or so, maybe a little longer, a growing importance of customers' first-party data versus third-party data that maybe in the past that you've been purchasing to augment gaps from platforms that are increasingly being regulated or commoditized. So we believe customers are putting their most valuable data into CRM. And we'd like to know how you're going to help customers realize the value of their own first-party data. Are we going to be able to track this with multi-cloud adoption or Customer 360? And just sort of a little bit of a follow-on, with this data mosaic you've been building between MuleSoft, Einstein, Customer 360 and Tableau, do you feel you have the right data mosaic in place today to help customers realize that value?"

EMEA up 42% was a really impressive result given the kind of macro uncertainty, and you guys are closing the quarter in October, which had a lot of Brexit uncertainty. Is it just a better environment than I'm thinking about over in Europe? Or is the sort of the priority from the CIO just over sort of overtaking any uncertainty people have about that spending environment?"

What do you view as sort of core competencies that need to be set by global leadership versus providing regional leadership with the flexibility to make the changes or run the business in a way that they see is most appropriate on the ground in that market?"
