How did some of these larger transformational deals â€“ how do you see that playing out the rest of the year or is some of that business harder to come by just because it is more complex?"

And then I know you don't guide CRPO beyond a quarter.

Are you seeing similar trends for the month of May? And then maybe for Mark Hawkins, just on the expense side, there are a lot of questions that this environment may kind of permanently shift some of the expenses across tech. Do you think there's some permanent lasting effect that can inherently make you more profitable through this as we exit out?"

I mean, I think between you, Gavin and Bret, you all mentioned that there's a greater understanding of the imperative to spend on digital transformation today, yet you obviously have some prudent guidance out there for the second half of the year. So, yeah, when you talk to CEOs, what do you want to start hearing from them that gives you confidence that their interest is going to start translating into bookings? Is it simply just business confidence? Better understanding of sort of what's going to happen in the fall around COVID? Just kind of curious so we can keep an eye on some of the broader data points out there and try to triangulate to your thinking on business momentum."

You gave us the revenue impact for Vlocity, but I'd be curious what the margin impact from that transaction was. And then more broadly, the second part is at Analyst Day 3 months ago, there was discussion around taking time to digest between deals. Tableau officially, officially closed 3 months ago, where you got the go-ahead to integrate. Now we're seeing another acquisition. It's not as big as Tableau, but it's certainly not a small one either. I'm just curious to get an update on where the mindset is on M&A going forward from here."
